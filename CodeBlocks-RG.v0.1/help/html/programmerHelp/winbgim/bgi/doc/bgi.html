WINBGIM: Borland BGI Graphics & Mouse for Windows
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>
    The WINBGIM Library -- Version 6.0 -- August 9, 2004
    <BR>
    Borland BGI Graphics and Mouse
    <BR>
    For Windows Applications
</H2>
The winbgim library allows you to use BGI graphics routines and
simple mouse support for Windows applications that you write with
<A HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/cs1300/README.html">CS1300's mingw32 gnu C++ compiler</A>
or with the
Borland C++ compiler (version 5.02).
It will probably work with other Windows compilers, too,
but I haven't tried it.
<P>
The
library originates from
<A HREF="http://www.ispras.ru/~knizhnik/">
Konstantin Knizhnik's winbgi shareware.</A>
I spent some time adding
a new <CODE>initwindow</CODE> function (to allow the graphics window to be
initially opened at any size) and three new functions to allow simple
mouse-driven processing. Mark Richardson then added some new functions
to allow more than sixteen colors.
<P>
You are welcome to use and modify this library as you like. Let me know
if you make interesting modifications.
<P>
<H3>How to use the winbgim library for the free mingw32 gnu C++ compiler</H3>
<OL>  
<P>
<LI>Download and install the free cs1300 tools, as described in
<A HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/cs1300/README.html">
www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/cs1300/README.html</A>.
<P>
<LI>The header file: Change to the cs1300\include subdirectory and check whether you
have the file graphics.h. If not, then download this file into that
directory
 by holding down the left-shift key
and clicking on this link:    
    <A HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/cs1300/include/graphics.h">www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/cs1300/include/graphics.h</A>. 
<P>
<LI>The archieved library file: Change to the cs1300\lib subdirectory
and check whether you have the file libbgi.a. If not, then download
this file into that directory by holding down the left-shift key and
clicking on this link:
    <A HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/cs1300/doc/lib/libbgi.a">www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/cs1300/lib/libbgi.a</A>.
<P>
<LI>Write your program as you normally would, using the BGI graphics
functions. Be sure to include
<CODE>graphics.h</CODE>.
<P>
<LI>
When you create an executable (exe) program that uses the winbgim
library, you must add the six options <CODE>-lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32
-luuid -loleaut32 -lole32</CODE> (in
that order) after any other file arguments to the compiler. For
example, to compile the <A HREF="bgidemo0.cpp">bgidemo0.cpp</A>
program you would give the compile command:
<PRE>
g++ bgidemo0.cpp -lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32 -o bgidemo0.exe
</PRE>
Note that each of these library options begins with the letter l (not the
number one). 
<P>
If you are working with the CS1300 version of the g++ compiler
(from <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/cs1300/README.html">
www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/cs1300/README.html</a>), then you can get
all these libraries automatically by using the bgi++ command instead
of
g++.  For example:
<PRE>
bgi++ bgidemo0.cpp -o bgidemo0.exe
</PRE>

This command creates an executable file called
bgidemo0.exe.
Note that when it runs, it creates a small graphics window where all
the bgi operations are performed. Any text i/o with cin and cout will
be done in the other (console) window.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
<H3>Graphics Stuff in the Library</H3>
<B>Usual BGI Stuff:</B> You can use any of the 
<A HREF="index-3.html">Borland BGI graphics functions</A>.
<P>
<B>Initialization:</B> Normally, you initialize the BGI graphics by a call to 
<CODE>detectgraph</CODE> and a call to <CODE>initgraph</CODE>.
You can still use those two function calls, or you may call a
new function named <CODE>initwindow</CODE>. The function
has two arguments that are the size of the graphics window that you
want to create in pixels (width and height). For example, you can
create a window that is 450 pixels wide and 300 pixels high with
the statement:
<PRE>
initwindow(450, 450);
</PRE>
<P>
<B>RGB Colors:</B> 
The winbgim package supports two
types of colors that may be used with any of the functions that expect
colors as arguments:
<OL>
<LI> The sixteen ordinary BGI colors. These are the integers 0 through
15 or you may use the symbolic names: 
<PRE>
     BLACK          BLUE          GREEN         CYAN
     RED            MAGENTA       BROWN         LIGHTGRAY
     DARKGRAY       LIGHTBLUE     LIGHTGREEN    LIGHTCYAN
     LIGHTRED       LIGHTMAGENTA  YELLOW        WHITE
</PRE>
<P>
<LI> A color may be specified from red, green and blue components
using a new macro called COLOR(r,g,b). Each of the r,g,b arguments
must be a number in the range 0 to 255. For example, COLOR(255,100,0)
is a mostly red color with some green and no blue. If you create
one of these colors, it may be used as an argument to any of the BGI
functions that expect a color. These colors may also be returned from
BGI functions such as getbkcolor. 
</OL>
<P>
Three other macros (RED_VALUE, GREEN_VALUE, BLUE_VALUE, IS_BGI_COLOR 
and IS_RGB_COLOR) are explained in the examples below.
<P>
<B>RGB Examples:</B>
<PRE>
    setcolor(BLUE);             // Change drawing color to BLUE.
    setcolor(COLOR(255,100,0);  // Change drawing color to reddish-green.
    setpalette(4, BLUE);        // Change palette entry 4 to BLUE.
    setpalette(4, COLOR(9,9,9));// Change palette entry 4 to nearly black.
     
    int current = getcolor( );  // Set current to current drawing color.

    if (IS_BGI_COLOR(current))  // Check whether it is a BGI color.
       cout &lt;&lt; "Current BGI drawing color is: " << current << end;

    if (IS_RGB_COLOR(current))  // Check whether it is an RGB color.
       cout &lt;&lt; "Current RGB drawing color has these components:\n"
            &lt;&lt; "Red:   " << RED_VALUE(current)   &lt;&lt; '\n'
            &lt;&lt; "Green: " << GREEN_VALUE(current) &lt;&lt; '\n'
            &lt;&lt; "Blue:  " << BLUE_VALUE(current)  &lt;&lt; '\n'
</PRE>





<DL>
<DT><CODE>int getdisplaycolor(int color)</CODE>
<DD>
The actual color placed on the screen with putpixel
might not be this exact rgb color that you want because of video mode
limitations.
The return value of this function tells you what actual color will
be put on the screen for a requested color.
</DL>

<P>
<H3>Mouse Stuff in the Library</H3>
There are three functions to use the mouse:
   <UL>
   <LI><CODE>int&nbsp;mousex(&nbsp;)</CODE> <BR> 
       <CODE>int&nbsp;mousey(&nbsp;)</CODE><BR>
   These return the current x and y coordinates of the mouse. If the 
   mouse has never been in the graphics window, then both coordinates
   are zero. If the mouse used to be in the window, but now it has
   gone elsewhere, then the coordinates are the last known position
   within the window.
   <LI><CODE>bool&nbsp;ismouseclick(kind)</CODE>
   This function returns true if there is an unprocessed mouse event of
   the specified kind.
   The argument to <CODE>ismouseclick</CODE> is
   one of these constants from the <CODE>winbgim.h</CODE> file:
   <DL>
   <DT><CODE>WM_MOUSEMOVE</CODE>
   <DD>if you want to detect a mouse movement
   <DT><CODE>WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK</CODE>
   <DD>...detect when the left mouse button is double clicked
   <DT><CODE>WM_LBUTTONDOWN</CODE>
   <DD>...detect when the left mouse button is clicked down
   <DT><CODE>WM_LBUTTONUP</CODE>
   <DD>...detect when the left mouse button is released up
   <DT><CODE>WM_MBUTTONDBLCLK</CODE>
   <DD>...detect when the middle mouse button is double clicked
   <DT><CODE>WM_MBUTTONDOWN</CODE>
   <DD>...detect when the middle mouse button is clicked down
   <DT><CODE>WM_MBUTTONUP</CODE>
   <DD>...detect when the middle mouse button is released up
   <DT><CODE>WM_RBUTTONDBLCLK</CODE>
   <DD>...detect when the right mouse button is double clicked
   <DT><CODE>WM_RBUTTONDOWN</CODE>
   <DD>...detect when the right mouse button is clicked down
   <DT><CODE>WM_RBUTTONUP</CODE>
   <DD>...detect when the right mouse button is released up
   </DL>
   <P>
   The middle mouse button handlers aren't working on my machine.
   I haven't yet tracked down the reason--it could be a broken mouse
   or it could be a bug in my programming.
   <LI>A mouse event can be processed by calling
   <CODE>getmouseclick</CODE>
   (which gets the coordinates of the event), or by calling
   <CODE>clearmouseclick</CODE>
   (which processes the event without providing its coordinates).
   These two functions are described below.
   <LI><CODE>void&nbsp;getmouseclick(kind,&nbsp;int&amp;&nbsp;xint&amp;&nbsp;y)</CODE>
   This function sets x and y to the pixel coordinates of an
   unprocessed event of the specified kind. If there is no such
   event, then the function sets both x and y to -1.
   The value of the argument kind may be any of the constants
   listed above. After calling <CODE>getmouseclick</CODE>,
   for a particular kind of event, the <CODE>ismouseclick</CODE>
   will return false for that kind of event until another such event occurs.
   <LI><CODE>void&nbsp;clearmouseclick(kind)</CODE>
   This is just like <CODE>getmouseclick</CODE>, except it does not
   provide the x and y coordinates of the event.
   The value of the argument <CODE>kind</CODE> may be any of the constants
   listed above. After calling <CODE>clearmouseclick</CODE>,
   for a particular kind of event, the <CODE>ismouseclick</CODE>
   will return false for that kind of event until another such event occurs.
   <LI><CODE>void&nbsp;registermousehandler(kind,&nbsp;h)</CODE>
   Most mouse processing can be carried out with the
   <CODE>ismouseclick</CODE> and <CODE>getmouseclick</CODE>.
   But sometimes you need more control.
   In general, you can obtain more control by
   writing a different "handler function"
   to handle each different
   kind of mouse event, and you "register" each of your
   handlers by calling <CODE>registermousehandler</CODE>.
   The first argument to <CODE>registermousehandler</CODE> is
   one of the constants listed above.
   The second argument to <CODE>registermousehandler</CODE>
   must be the name of the handler function that you wrote. This
   function must be a void function with two int parameters.
   Whenever the specified mouse event occurs, your handler will
   be called and the two int parameters will be the x and y positions
   where the event happened.
   </UL>
<P>
<H3>A Mouse Example with <CODE>ismouseclick</CODE> and <CODE>getmouseclick</CODE></H3>
Suppose that you want a program to wait for a left mouse click.
Then the program should print the x and y coordinates of the
most recent left click. Here's a function to accomplish that:
<PRE>
void wait_for_left_click( )
{
    const int DELAY = 50; // Milliseconds of delay between checks
    int x, y;

    while (!ismouseclick(WM_LBUTTONDOWN))
        delay(DELAY);
    getmouseclick(WM_LBUTTONDOWN, x, y);
    cout << "Latest left click at: " << x << " " << y << endl;
}
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>A Mouse Example with a Handler</H3>
Suppose that whenever the right mouse button is clicked you want to
print a message with the x and y coordinates of the click. Then you
would start by writing your handler function, perhaps like this:
<PRE>
void my_right_click_handler(int x, int y)
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Right mouse click at " 
         &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; " and " &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</PRE>
Now, somewhere in your program (after you've initialized the
graphics window), you must register this fine handler with the
statement:
<PRE>
registermousehandler(WM_RBUTTONDOWN, my_right_click_handler);
</PRE>
<P>
In general, the work carried out in a handler must be small. If you
need to do a lot of work, have the handler change a global variable
that will later trigger the large work. Then the handler can
return quickly.
<P>
<H3>Keyboard Stuff in the Library</H3>
There are three functions that were originally part of Borland's
conio.h. These functions are now in winbgim.h, and you do not need
to include conio.h to use them::
   <UL>
   <LI><CODE>void&nbsp;delay(int&nbsp;millisec)</CODE> <BR> 
       <CODE>int&nbsp;getch(&nbsp;)</CODE><BR>
       <CODE>int&nbsp;kbhit(&nbsp;)</CODE><BR>
   <P><LI>
   The first function delays the compuation for the specified number of
   milliseconds. 
   <P><LI>
   The getch function gets a character from the keyboard
   without waiting for any <enter> key. In order to use getch, the
   graphics window must be active (by clicking in it or clicking on
   its title bar). The actual return value from getch is usually the
   ASCII value of the key that was pressed, so if you want to store
   this into a character, you need: 
   <CODE>c&nbsp;=&nbsp;(char)&nbsp;getch(&nbsp;);
   If you press one of the keypad keys (arrows, Home, etc.), then 
   getch first returns the value 0. Then, at the next call, it will
   <DL>
   <DT><CODE>KEY_HOME</CODE>
   <DT><CODE>KEY_UP</CODE>
   <DT><CODE>KEY_PGUP</CODE>
   <DT><CODE>KEY_LEFT</CODE>
   <DT><CODE>KEY_CENTER</CODE>
   <DT><CODE>KEY_RIGHT</CODE>
   <DT><CODE>KEY_END</CODE>
   <DT><CODE>KEY_DOWN</CODE>
   <DT><CODE>KEY_PGDN</CODE>
   <DT><CODE>KEY_INSERT</CODE>
   <DT><CODE>KEY_DELETE</CODE>
   </DL>
   <P><LI>
   </CODE>The kbhit function returns 0 if there are no characters now waiting
   to be read (with getch). It returns a non-zero if there are some
   characters waiting to be read.
   </UL>
<P>
<H3>Double-Buffering Support</H3>
<BR>
I added two functions, <CODE>getactivepage()</CODE> and
<CODE>getvisualpage()</CODE> to help support double-buffering.
They return the page number of the active page (where drawing is
currently taking place) and the visual page (the one on the screen).
The original winbgi was designed to support up to 16 pages, but I have
only used pages 1 and 2 myself.  NOTE: Using page number 0 might
mess up the colors. I use pages 1-2 for double buffering. 
<P>
<H3>Support for Writing to the Graphics Screen</H3>
<BR>
I added an outputstream, <CODE>bgiout</CODE>. It's
used is described in <a href="bgiout.html">bgiout.html</a>.
<P>
<H3>Support for Printing, Reading and Writing Images</H3>
<P>
The graphics window now has a print option in the windows menu button,
so the user can print the screen at any time. In additon, there are
these new functions:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="getimage.html">getimage</A>
<LI><A HREF="imagesize.html">imagesize</A>
<LI><A HREF="printimage.html">printimage</A>

<LI><A HREF="readimagefile.html">readimagefile</A> 
<LI><A HREF="writeimagefile.html">writeimagefile</A>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Support for Multiple Windows</H3>
<P>
The initiwindow function can now be called multiple times to create
more than one graphics window.  The <a
href="initwindow.html">initwindow documentation</a> describes how
these multiple windows are used.

<H3>Writing Windows Programs</H3>
<P>
You may have noticed that any program that's compiled with g++ or
bgi++ will always open a DOS command window when the program is run.
If you want to stop this window from opening, then add the option
-mwindows to the compile line (just after g++ or bgi++).
