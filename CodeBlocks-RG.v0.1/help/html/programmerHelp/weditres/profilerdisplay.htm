<h2>The profiler</h2>
<p>This utility displays the results of a __profile.data file generated by a
program that was compiled with the profiling options. </p>
<p>In its default display it will sort all functions by decreasing time and show
the results. When you select the &quot;modules&quot; view, it will sort all
modules that contributed to the executable and that were used by the profiling
run in decreasing order. Within each module it will sort all functions that were
executed in this module by decreasing order.</p>
<p>When you double click in a function display line, it will show the text of
the function, together with the number of times the program executed each of the
lines in the function.</p>
