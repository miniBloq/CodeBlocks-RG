<h3><a name="_Toc494631981">Group Boxes</a></h3>
<p>A <i>group box</i> is a rectangle that surrounds a set of controls, such as
check boxes or radio buttons, with application-defined text (label) in its upper
left corner. The sole purpose of a group box is to organize controls related by
a common purpose (usually indicated by the label). The group box has only one
style, defined by the constant BS_GROUPBOX. Because a group box cannot be
selected, it has no check state, focus state, or push state. An application
cannot send messages to a group box.</p>
