<title>Adding a dialog box</title>

<h2>Adding a dialog box</h2>
<p>To create a new dialog box select the &quot;Objects&quot; menu and then
&quot;New dialog&quot;.</p>
<p>This will create an empty dialog box. A new window appears at the right side,
the properties window.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="editor2.gif" width="279" height="251"></p>
<p align="left">The contents of this window can change, according to what object
is selected. When you create a dialog box, it is automatically selected, and the
properties window displays the associated information.</p>
<p align="left">Each object will be referenced in your program by a numeric
identifier, in this case 21600. The dialog editor chooses a number according to
which dialog identifiers are already used. You can change this number but is
better to leave the defaults since you could create problems with other
identifiers.</p>
<p align="left">To avoid using a bare number, each identifier will be provided a
corresponding #define instruction to give it a symbolic name or
&quot;Symbol&quot; for short. In this case the editor will write in the header
file a line like this:</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Courier">#define DLG_21600&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21600</font></p>
<p align="left">You can (and should) change the default symbol name to something
like INPUT_DIALOG or DID_INPUT. The names are case sensitive, and following an
established C tradition the names are in upper case since they are macros. This
is not mandatory but it is useful for avoiding conflicts with other identifiers
in your program.</p>
<p align="left">Note that the properties window is a modal window. You can't do
anything else when it is open. To return to the editor you should close that
window.</p>
