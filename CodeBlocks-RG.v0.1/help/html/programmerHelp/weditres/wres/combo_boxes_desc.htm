<h2><a name="_Toc494632021">Combo Boxes</a></h2>
<p>A <i>combo box</i> is a unique type of control, defined by the COMBOBOX
class, that combines much of the functionality of a list box and an edit
control.</p>
<p>This overview describes the types and styles of combo box, the parts of a
combo box, the use of an owner-drawn combo box, and how to subclass a combo box.
Additional features of combo boxes are also discussed.</p>
<p>The Win32® API provides three types of combo boxes:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l7 level1 lfo14;tab-stops:list 36.0pt">Simple combo boxes (CBS_SIMPLE)</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l7 level1 lfo14;tab-stops:list 36.0pt">Drop-down combo boxes (CBS_DROPDOWN)</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l7 level1 lfo14;tab-stops:list 36.0pt">Drop-down list boxes (CBS_DROPDOWNLIST)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also a number of combo box styles that define specific properties.
For example, two styles enable an application to create an owner-drawn combo
box, making the application responsible for displaying information in the
control.</p>
<p>A combo box consists of a list and a selection field. The list presents the
options that a user can select and the selection field displays the current
selection. Except in drop-down list boxes, the selection field is an edit
control and can be used to enter text not available in the list.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc494632023">Combo Box Types and Styles</a></h2>
<p>Combo boxes can be characterized by type and style. Combo box types determine
whether the combo box list is a drop-down list and whether the selection field
is an edit control. A drop-down list appears only when the user opens it, so it
uses less screen space than a list that is always visible. If the selection
field is an edit control, the user can enter information not available in the
list; otherwise, the user can only select items in the list.</p>
<p>The following table shows the three combo box types and indicates their
drop-down list and edit control attributes.</p>

<p>Combo box styles define specific properties of a combo box. You can combine
styles; however some styles only apply to certain combo box types. For a table
of combo box styles, see <a href="/wres/combo_box_styles.htm">Combo Box Styles</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc494632024">Combo Box List</a></h2>
<p>A <i>list</i> is the portion of a combo box that displays the items a user
can select. Typically, an application initializes the contents of the list when
it creates a combo box. Any list item selected by the user is the <i>current
selection</i>. In simple and drop-down combo boxes, the user can type in the
selection field instead of selecting a list item. In these cases, there is no
current selection. For more information, see <a href="#CurrentSelection">Current
Selection</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc494632025">List Contents</a></h3>
<p>When an application creates a combo box, it typically initializes the combo
box by adding one or more items to the list. Later, an application may add or
delete list items, reinitialize the list, or retrieve item information from it.</p>
<p>An application adds list items to a combo box by sending the <b>CB_ADDSTRING</b>
message to it. The specified item is added to the end of the list or, in a
sorted combo box, in its correct sorted position based on the item's string. In
an unsorted combo box, an application can use the <b>CB_INSERTSTRING</b>
message to insert an item at a specific position. Once added, a list item is
identified by its position.</p>
<p>By using the <b>CB_FINDSTRING</b>
or <b>CB_FINDSTRINGEXACT</b>
message, an application can determine the position of a list item. <b>CB_FINDSTRING</b>
finds an item whose string begins with the specified string. <b>CB_FINDSTRINGEXACT</b>
finds an item whose string matches the string exactly. Neither message is case
sensitive.</p>
<p>An application can remove a list item by using the <b>CB_DELETESTRING</b>
message. If an application needs to reinitialize the combo box list, it can
first clear its entire contents by using the <b>CB_RESETCONTENT</b>
message. When adding multiple items to the list after a combo box has already
been shown, an application can clear the redraw flag to prevent the combo box
from being repainted after each item is added. For more information about
redrawing, see the description of the <b>WM_SETREDRAW</b>
message.</p>
<p>To retrieve the string associated with a list item, an application can use
the <b>CB_GETLBTEXT</b> message.
The item's string is copied to the buffer specified by the application. To
ensure that the buffer is large enough to receive the string, the application
can first use the <b>CB_GETLBTEXTLEN</b>
message to determine the length of the string. To get the number of list items
in a combo box, an application can use the <b>CB_GETCOUNT</b>
message.</p>
<h3><a name="CurrentSelection">Current Selection</a></h3>
<p>The <i>current selection</i> is a list item the user has selected; the
selected text appears in the selection field of the combo box. However, in the
case of a simple combo box or a drop-down combo box, the current selection is
only one form of possible user input in a combo box. The user can also type text
in the selection field.</p>
<p>The current selection is identified by the zero-based index of the selected
list item. An application can set and retrieve it at any time. The parent window
or dialog box procedure receives notification when the user changes the current
selection for a combo box. The parent window or dialog box is not notified when
the application changes the selection.</p>
<p>When a combo box is created, there is no current selection. This is also true
for a simple or drop-down combo box, if the user has edited the contents of the
selection field. To set the current selection, an application sends the <b>CB_SETCURSEL</b>
message to the combo box. An application can also use the <b>CB_SELECTSTRING</b>
message to set the current selection to a list item whose string begins with a
specified string. To determine the current selection, an application sends the <b>CB_GETCURSEL</b>
message to the combo box. If there is no current selection, this message returns
CB_ERR.</p>
<p>When the user changes the current selection in a combo box, the parent window
or dialog-box procedure receives a <b>WM_COMMAND</b>
message with the notification message <b>CBN_SELCHANGE</b>
in the high-order word of the <i>wParam</i> parameter. This notification message
is not sent when the current selection is set using the <b>CB_SETCURSEL</b>
message.</p>
<p>A drop-down combo box or drop-down list box sends the <b>CBN_CLOSEUP</b>
notification to the parent window or dialog-box procedure when the drop-down
list closes. If the user changed the current selection, the combo box also sends
the <b>CBN_SELCHANGE</b> notification when the drop-down list closes. To execute
a specific process each time the user selects a list item, you can handle either
the <b>CBN_SELCHANGE</b> or <b>CBN_CLOSEUP</b> notification message. Typically,
you would wait for the <b>CBN_CLOSEUP</b> notification before processing a
change in the current selection. This can be particularly important if a
significant amount of processing is required.</p>
<p>An application could also process the notification messages <b>CBN_SELENDOK</b>
and <b>CBN_SELENDCANCEL</b>. The
system sends <b>CBN_SELENDOK</b> when the user selects a list item, or selects
an item and then closes the list. This indicates that the user has finished, and
that the selection should be processed. <b>CBN_SELENDCANCEL</b> is sent when the
user selects an item, but then selects another control, presses <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">ESC</span>
while the drop-down list is open, or closes the dialog box. This indicates that
the user's selection should be ignored. <b>CBN_SELENDOK</b> is sent before every
<b>CBN_SELCHANGE</b> message.</p>
<p>In a simple combo box, the system sends the <b>CBN_DBLCLK</b>
notification message when the user double-clicks a list item. In a drop-down
combo box or drop-down list, a single click hides the list, so it is not
possible to double-click an item.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc494632027">Drop-Down Lists</a></h3>
<p>Certain notifications and messages apply only to combo boxes containing
drop-down lists. When a drop-down list is open or closed, the parent window of a
combo box receives a notification in the form of a <b>WM_COMMAND</b>
message. If the list is being opened, the high-order word of <i>wParam</i> is <b>CBN_DROPDOWN</b>.
If the list is being closed, it is <b>CBN_CLOSEUP</b>.</p>
<p>An application can open the list of a drop-down combo box or drop-down list
box by using the <b>CB_SHOWDROPDOWN</b>
message. It can determine whether the list is open by using the <b>CB_GETDROPPEDSTATE</b>
message and can determine the coordinates of a drop-down list by using the <b>CB_GETDROPPEDCONTROLRECT</b>
message. An application can also increase the width of a drop-down list by using
the <b>CB_SETDROPPEDWIDTH</b>
message.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc494632028">Edit Control Selection Fields</a></h2>
<p>The <i>selection field</i> is the portion of a combo box that displays the
currently selected list item. In simple and drop-down combo boxes, the selection
field is an edit control and can be used to enter text that is not in the list.</p>
<p>An application can retrieve or set the contents of the selection field and
can determine or set the edit selection. The application can also limit the
amount of text a user can type in the selection field. When the contents of the
selection field change, the system sends notification messages to the parent
window or dialog box procedure.</p>
<p>To retrieve the content of the selection field, an application can send the <b>WM_GETTEXT</b>
message to the combo box. To set the contents of the selection field of a simple
or drop-down combo box, an application can send the <b>WM_SETTEXT</b>
message to the combo box.</p>
<p>The <i>edit selection</i> is the range of selected text, if any, in the
selection field of a simple or drop-down combo box. An application can determine
the starting and ending character positions of the current selection by using
the <b>CB_GETEDITSEL</b> message.
It can also select characters in the edit selection by using the <b>CB_SETEDITSEL</b>
message.</p>
<p>Initially, the amount of text that the user can type into the selection field
is limited by the size of the selection field. However, if the combo box has the
CBS_AUTOHSCROLL style, the text can continue beyond the size of the selection
field. An application can use the <b>CB_LIMITTEXT</b>
message to limit the amount of text a user can type into the selection field,
regardless of whether the control has the CBS_AUTOHSCROLL style.</p>
<p>When the user edits the content of the selection field, the parent window or
dialog box procedure receives notification messages. The <b>CBN_EDITUPDATE</b>
message is sent first, indicating that the text in the selection field has been
edited. After the altered text is displayed, the system sends <b>CBN_EDITCHANGE</b>.
When the selection field content changes as the result of a list item being
selected, these messages are not sent.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc494632029">Owner-Drawn Combo Boxes</a></h2>
<p>An application can create an <i>owner-drawn</i> combo box to take
responsibility for painting list items. The parent window or dialog box of an
owner-drawn combo box (its <i>owner</i>) receives <b>WM_DRAWITEM</b>
messages when a portion of the combo box needs to be painted. An owner-drawn
combo box can list information other than, or in addition to, text strings.
Owner-drawn combo boxes can be of any type. However, the edit control in a
simple or drop-down combo box can only display text, while the owner paints the
selection field in a drop-down list box.</p>
<p>The owner of an owner-drawn combo box must process the <b>WM_DRAWITEM</b>
message. This message is sent whenever a portion of the combo box must be
redrawn. The owner may need to process other messages, depending on the styles
specified for the combo box.</p>
<p>An application can create an owner-drawn combo box by specifying the
CBS_OWNERDRAWFIXED or CBS_OWNERDRAWVARIABLE style. If all list items in the
combo box are the same height, such as strings or icons, an application can use
the CBS_OWNERDRAWFIXED style. If list items are of varying height, like bitmaps
of different size, an application can use the CBS_OWNERDRAWVARIABLE style.</p>
<p>The owner of an owner-drawn combo box can process a <b>WM_MEASUREITEM</b>
message to specify the dimensions of list items in the combo box. If the
application creates the combo box by using the CBS_OWNERDRAWFIXED style, the
system sends the <b>WM_MEASUREITEM</b> message only once. The dimensions
specified by the owner are used for all list items. If the CBS_OWNERDRAWVARIABLE
style is used, the system sends a <b>WM_MEASUREITEM</b> message for each list
item added to the combo box. The owner can determine or set the height of a list
item at any time by using the <b>CB_GETITEMHEIGHT</b>
and <b>CB_SETITEMHEIGHT</b>
messages, respectively.</p>
<p>If the information displayed in an owner-drawn combo box includes text, an
application can keep track of the text for each list item by specifying the
CBS_HASSTRINGS style. Combo boxes with the CBS_SORT style are sorted based on
this text. If a combo box is sorted and not of the CBS_HASSTRINGS style, the
owner must process the <b>WM_COMPAREITEM</b>
message.</p>
<p>In an owner-drawn combo box, the owner must keep track of list items
containing information other than or in addition to text. One convenient way to
do this is to save the handle to the information as item data. For more
information about item data, see <a href="../../api/api2/combobox_5d0z.htm">Data
Associated with List Items</a>. To free data objects associated with items in a
combo box, the owner can process the <b>WM_DELETEITEM</b>
message.</p>
<p>For an example of an owner-drawn combo box, see <a href="../../api/api2/combobox_9ge0.htm">Creating
an Owner-Drawn Combo Box</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc494632030">Subclassed Combo Boxes</a></h2>
<p><i>Subclassing</i> is a procedure that allows an application to intercept and
process messages sent or posted to a window. By using subclassing, an
application can substitute its own processing for certain messages, while
leaving most message processing to the class-defined window procedure.</p>
<p>When the operating system creates a window, it saves information about it in
an internal data structure that includes a pointer to the window procedure. To
subclass a window, an application calls the <b>SetClassLong</b>
function to replace the pointer to that procedure with a pointer to an
application-defined subclass procedure. Thereafter, all messages to the window
are sent to the subclass procedure. This procedure then uses the <b>CallWindowProc</b>
function to pass unprocessed messages to the original window procedure. For a
description of the message processing performed by the COMBOBOX class window
procedure, see <a href="../../api/api2/combobox_6qeq.htm">Default Combo Box
Behavior</a>.</p>
<p>When the combo box is outside a dialog box, an application cannot process the
TAB, ENTER, and ESC keys unless it uses a subclass procedure. When a simple or
drop-down combo box receives the input focus, it immediately sets the focus to
its child edit control. Therefore, an application must subclass the edit control
to intercept keyboard input for a simple or drop-down combo box. For an example
of this, see <a href="../../api/api2/combobox_30l4.htm">Subclassing a Combo Box</a>.</p>
<p>If a subclass procedure processes the <b>WM_PAINT</b>
message, it must use the <b>BeginPaint</b>
function to prepare for painting. Before calling the <b>EndPaint</b>
function, it passes the device-context (DC) handle as the <i>wParam</i>
parameter for the window procedure. If <b>EndPaint</b> is called first, the
class window procedure does no painting because <b>EndPaint</b> validates the
entire window.</p>
<p>A technique related to subclassing is <i>superclassing</i>. A superclass
resembles any other class except that its window procedure does not call <b>DefWindowProc</b>
to handle unprocessed messages. Instead, it passes unprocessed messages to the
window procedure for the parent window class. Follow the guidelines in Window
Procedures to avoid problems that can occur with subclassing and
superclassing.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc494632031">Special Combo Box Features</a></h2>
<p>The Win32 API provides special-purpose messages and functions that enable an
application to display a directory listing in a combo box, associate data with
list items in a combo box, and change the keyboard interface for a drop-down
combo box or drop-down list box.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc494632032">Directory Lists</a></h3>
<p>An application can add the names of files or subdirectories to a combo box by
sending the <b>CB_DIR</b> message
to it. The <i>wParam</i> parameter for this message specifies the attributes of
the files to add, and the <i>lParam</i> parameter is a pointer to the text
string that defines the file specification.</p>
<p>You can use the <b>DlgDirListComboBox</b>
function to replace the contents of a combo box in a dialog box. The function
fills the combo box with the names of drives, directories, and files that match
a specified set of criteria. The <b>DlgDirSelectComboBoxEx</b>
function retrieves the current selection in a combo box initialized by <b>DlgDirListComboBox</b>.
These functions make it possible for the user to select a drive, directory, or
file from a combo box without typing the location and name of the file.</p>
<p>The <b>DlgDirListComboBox</b> and <b>DlgDirSelectComboBoxEx</b> functions and
the <b>CB_DIR</b> message are similar to the <b>DlgDirList</b>
and <b>DlgDirSelectEx</b>
functions and the <b>LB_DIR</b>
message used with list boxes.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc494632033">Data Associated with List Items</a></h3>
<p>An application can associate data with the list items in a combo box. The <b>CB_SETITEMDATA</b>
message associates a <b>DWORD</b> value with a list item, and the <b>CB_GETITEMDATA</b>
retrieves the value associated with a list item.</p>
<p>The example in <a href="../../api/api2/combobox_9ge0.htm">Creating an
Owner-Drawn Combo Box</a> uses item data to associate a constant with each item
in a drop-down list box. Such a unique value identifies each item independent of
its sorted position.</p>
<p>Other applications might use item data to associate a handle or pointer with
a list item. If so, an application can process a <b>WM_DELETEITEM</b>
message to delete or free the specified object when the list item is deleted</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc494632034">The Extended User Interface</a></h3>
<p>Drop-down combo boxes and drop-down list boxes support an alternative
keyboard interface called the <i>extended user interface</i>. By default, the F4
key opens or closes the list, and the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">DOWN
ARROW</span> changes the current selection. In a combo box with the extended
user interface, however, the F4 key is disabled and pressing the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">DOWN
ARROW</span> key opens the drop-down list.</p>
<p>To select the user interface for a combo box, an application can send the <b>CB_SETEXTENDEDUI</b>
message to the combo box. A TRUE value for the <i>wParam</i> parameter enables
the extended user interface; a FALSE value sets the default user interface. To
determine whether a combo box uses the extended user interface, an application
can send the <b>CB_GETEXTENDEDUI</b>
message to the combo box.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc494632035">Combo Box Notifications</a></h2>
<p>Messages from combo boxes are sent as notifications in the form of <b>WM_COMMAND</b>
messages. The notification message is stored in the high word of the <i>wParam</i>
parameter, and an application can process the following combo box notification
messages.</p>
