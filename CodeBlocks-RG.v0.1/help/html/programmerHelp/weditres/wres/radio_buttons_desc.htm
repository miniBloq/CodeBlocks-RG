<h3><a name="_Toc494631979">Radio Buttons</a></h3>
<p>A <i>radio button</i> consists of a round button and application-defined text
(a label), an icon, or a bitmap that indicates a choice the user can make by
selecting the button. An application typically uses radio buttons in a group box
to permit the user to choose from a set of related, but mutually exclusive
options. For example, the application might present a group of radio buttons
from which the user can select a format preference for text selected in the
client area. The user could select a left-aligned, right-aligned, or centered
format by selecting the corresponding radio button. Typically, the user can
select only one option at a time from a set of radio buttons.</p>
<p>A radio button can be one of two styles: standard or automatic, as defined by
the constants BS_RADIOBUTTON and BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON. Each style can assume two
check states: checked (a dot in the button) or cleared (no dot in the button).
Repeatedly selecting a radio button (standard or automatic) toggles it from
checked to cleared and back again.</p>
<p>When the user selects either state, the radio button receives the keyboard
focus. The system sends the button's parent window a <a href="../../api/api2/menus_8wh0.htm"><b>WM_COMMAND</b></a>
message containing the <a href="../../api/api2/buttons_8810.htm"><b>BN_CLICKED</b></a>
notification code. The parent window doesn't acknowledge this message if it
comes from an automatic radio button because the system automatically sets the
check state for that style. But the parent window should acknowledge the message
if it comes from a radio button because the parent window is responsible for
setting the check state for that style. Regardless of the radio button style,
the system automatically repaints the button as its state changes.</p>
<p>When the user selects an automatic radio button, the system automatically
sets the check state of all other radio buttons within the same group to
cleared. The same behavior is available for standard radio buttons by using the
WS_GROUP style, as discussed in <a href="../../api/api2/dlgboxes_7foz.htm">Dialog
Boxes</a>.</p>
