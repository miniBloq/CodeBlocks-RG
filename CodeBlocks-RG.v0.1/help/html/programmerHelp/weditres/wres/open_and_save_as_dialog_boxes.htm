  <h2>Open and Save As Dialog Boxes</h2>
  <hr SIZE="1">
  <p>The <b>Open</b> dialog box lets the user specify the drive, directory, and
  the name of a file or set of files to open. You create and display an <b>Open</b>
  dialog box by initializing an <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_OPENFILENAME_str_cpp">
  OPENFILENAME</MSHelp:link>
  structure and passing the structure to the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_GetOpenFileName_cpp">
  GetOpenFileName</MSHelp:link>
  function.</p>
  <p>The <b>Save As</b> dialog box lets the user specify the drive, directory,
  and name of a file to save. You create and display a <b>Save As</b> dialog box
  by initializing an <b>OPENFILENAME</b> structure and passing the structure to
  the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_GetSaveFileName_cpp">
  GetSaveFileName</MSHelp:link>
  function.</p>
  <p>Explorer-style <b>Open</b> and <b>Save As</b> dialog boxes provide
  user-interface features that are similar to the Microsoft® Windows®
  Explorer. However, the system continues to support old-style <b>Open</b> and <b>Save
  As</b> dialog boxes for applications that must be consistent with the
  old-style user interface.</p>
  <p>In addition to the difference in appearance, the Explorer-style and
  old-style dialog boxes differ in their use of custom templates and hook
  procedures for customizing the dialog boxes. However, the Explorer-style and
  old-style dialog boxes have the same behavior for most basic operations, such
  as specifying a file name filter, validating the user's input, and getting the
  file name specified by the user. For more information about the Explorer-style
  and old-style dialog boxes, see <a href="#_win32_Open_and_Save_As_Dialog_Box_Customization" target="_self">Open
  and Save As Dialog Box Customization</a>.</p>
  <p>The following illustration shows a typical Explorer-style <b>Open</b>
  dialog box.</p>
  <p><img border="0" src="open_a6.gif"></p>
  <p>If the user specifies a file name and clicks the <b>OK</b> button, <b>GetOpenFileName</b>
  or <b>GetSaveFileName</b> returns TRUE. The buffer pointed to by the <b>lpstrFile</b>
  member of the <b>OPENFILENAME</b> structure contains the full path and file
  name specified by the user.</p>
  <p>If the user cancels the <b>Open</b> or <b>Save As</b> dialog box or an
  error occurs, the function returns FALSE. To determine the cause of the error,
  call the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_CommDlgExtendedError_cpp">
  CommDlgExtendedError</MSHelp:link>
  function to retrieve the extended error value. If the <b>lpstrFile</b> buffer
  is too small to receive the full name, <b>CommDlgExtendedError</b> returns
  FNERR_BUFFERTOOSMALL and the first 2 bytes of the buffer pointed to by the <b>lpstrFile</b>
  member are set to an integer value specifying the size required to receive the
  full name.</p>
  <p>Explorer style dialog boxes are only available to 32-bit applications.
  16-bit applications cannot use thunking to display an Explorer-style dialog
  box.</p>
  <p><b>Windows 95/98/Me:</b> Win32-based applications that use the old-style
  dialog boxes do so using a thunk. This means that any pointer passed to your
  hook procedure is a nonpersistent copy of the data. For example, the <b>OPENFILENAME</b>
  pointer passed in the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_WM_INITDIALOG_cpp">
  WM_INITDIALOG</MSHelp:link>
  message is not a pointer to the buffer that you originally specified. If you
  need to pass private data to your hook procedure, bundle it in a structure and
  store a pointer to the structure in the <b>lCustData</b> member of the <b>OPENFILENAME</b>
  structure.</p>

  <h3><a name="_win32_File_Names_and_Directories"></a>File Names and Directories</h3>
  <p>The information in this section applies to both Explorer-style and
  old-style <b>Open</b> and <b>Save As</b> dialog boxes.</p>
  <p>Before calling the <b>GetOpenFileName</b> or <b>GetSaveFileName</b>
  functions, the <b>lpstrFile</b> member of the <b>OPENFILENAME</b> structure
  must point to the buffer to receive the file name. The <b>nMaxFile</b> member
  must specify the size, in <b>TCHAR</b>s, of the <b>lpstrFile</b> buffer. For
  an ANSI function this is the number of bytes, but for a Unicode function this
  is the number of characters.</p>
  <p>If the user specifies a file name and clicks the <b>OK</b> button, the
  dialog box copies the selected drive, directory, and file name to the <b>lpstrFile</b>
  buffer. The function also sets the <b>nFileOffset</b> and <b>nFileExtension</b>
  members to the offsets, in <b>TCHAR</b>s, from the start of the buffer to the
  file name and to the file name extension, respectively.</p>
  <p>To retrieve just the file name and extension, set the <b>lpstrFileTitle</b>
  member to point to a buffer and set the <b>nMaxFileTitle</b> member to the
  size, in <b>TCHAR</b>s, of the buffer. Alternatively, you can pass the <b>lpstrFile</b>
  buffer in a call to the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_GetFileTitle_cpp">
  GetFileTitle</MSHelp:link>
  function to get the display name of the selected file. Note, however, that the
  file name that <b>GetFileTitle</b> returns includes an extension only if that
  is the user's preference for displaying file names.</p>
  <p>The dialog box uses the current directory for the calling process as the
  initial directory from which to display files and directories. Use the or
  functions to get or change your current directory. To specify a different
  initial directory without changing your current directory, use the <b>lpstrInitialDir</b>
  member to specify the name of a directory. The dialog box automatically
  changes your current directory when the user selects a different drive or
  directory. To prevent the dialog box from changing your current directory, set
  the OFN_NOCHANGEDIR flag. This flag does not prevent the user from changing
  directories to find a file.</p>
  <p>To specify a default file name extension, use the <b>lpstrDefExt</b>
  member. If the user specifies a file name that does not have an extension, the
  dialog box adds your default extension. If you specify a default extension and
  the user specifies a file name with a different extension, the dialog box sets
  the OFN_EXTENSIONDIFFERENT flag.</p>
  <p>To let the user select more than one file from a directory, set the
  OFN_ALLOWMULTISELECT flag. For compatibility with older applications, the
  default multiple selection dialog box uses the old-style user interface. To
  display an Explorer-style multiple selection dialog box, you must also set the
  OFN_EXPLORER flag.</p>
  <p>If the user selects more than one file, the buffer pointed to by the <b>lpstrFile</b>
  member returns the path to the current directory followed by the file names of
  the selected files. The <b>nFileOffset</b> member is the offset to the first
  file name, and the <b>nFileExtension</b> member is not used. The following
  table describes the difference between Explorer-style and old-style dialog
  boxes in returning multiple file names.</p>
  <table class="clsStd">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Dialog box style</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Explorer-style dialog boxes</td>
        <td>The directory and file name strings are NULL separated, with an
          extra NULL character after the last file name. This format enables the
          Explorer-style dialog boxes to return long file names that include
          spaces.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Old-style dialog boxes</td>
        <td>The directory and file name strings are separated by spaces. For
          file names with spaces, the function uses short file names.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>You can use the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_FindFirstFile">
  FindFirstFile</MSHelp:link>
  function to convert between long and short file names.</p>
  <p>If you specify OFN_ALLOWMULTISELECT and the user selects only one file, the
  <b>lpstrFile</b> string does not have a separator between the path and file
  name.</p>
  <h3><a name="_win32_Filters"></a>Filters</h3>
  <p>The information in this section applies to both Explorer-style and old
  style <b>Open</b> and <b>Save As</b> dialog boxes.</p>
  <p>You can provide file name filters to assist the user in limiting the file
  names that the dialog box displays. A file name filter consists of a pair of
  null-terminated strings, a description and a pattern, one concatenated to the
  other. The dialog box displays the description to let the user pick which
  filter to use; and it uses the pattern to select the files to display.</p>
  <p>To specify the filters, set the <b>lpstrFilter</b> member of the <b>OPENFILENAME</b>
  structure to point to a buffer that contains an array of filter string pairs.
  The last string in the array must be followed by an extra null character.</p>
  <p>A pattern string can be a combination of valid file name characters and the
  asterisk (*). The asterisk is a wildcard that represents any combination of
  valid file name characters. The dialog box displays only those files that
  match the pattern. To specify multiple patterns for the same description, you
  must use a semicolon (;) to separate the patterns. Note that space characters
  in the pattern string can produce unexpected results.</p>
  <p>The following code fragment specifies two filters. The filter with the
  &quot;Source&quot; description has two patterns. If the user selects this
  filter, the dialog box displays only files that have the .C and .CXX
  extensions. Note, in the C programming language, a string enclosed in double
  quotes is null-terminated.</p>
  <pre class="clsCode" AUTOHILITE="1">OPENFILENAME ofn;       <font color="blue">//</font><font color="green"> common dialog box structure</font>

ofn.lpstrFilter = &quot;Source\0*.C;*.CXX\0All\0*.*\0&quot;
ofn.nFilterIndex = 1;</pre>
  <p>The <b>nFilterIndex</b> member of the <b>OPENFILENAME</b> structure
  specifies an index that indicates which filter the dialog box initially uses.
  The first filter in the buffer has index 1, the second 2, and so on. If the
  user changes the filter while using the dialog box, the <b>nFilterIndex</b>
  member is set to the index of the selected filter on return.</p>
  <p>You can create a custom filter by setting the <b>lpstrCustomFilter</b>
  member to the address of a buffer that contains a single filter, and by
  setting the <b>nMaxCustFilter</b> member to the size of the buffer, in
  characters or bytes. The dialog box always places the custom filter at the
  beginning of the list of filters and, on return, always updates the pattern
  part of the filter with the pattern from the filter selected by the user.</p>
  <p>For Explorer-style dialog boxes, the default extension may change if the
  user selects a different filter. If the user selects a filter whose first
  pattern is of the form *. <i>xxx</i> (that is, the extension does not include
  a wildcard character), the dialog box uses <i>xxx</i> as the default
  extension. This occurs only if you specified a default extension in the <b>lpstrDefExt</b>
  member of the <b>OPENFILENAME</b> structure. For example, if the user selects
  the &quot;Source\0*.C;*.CXX\0&quot; filter, the default extension changes to
  &quot;C&quot;. However, if you had defined the filter as
  &quot;Source\0*.C*\0&quot;, the default extension would not change because the
  extension includes a wildcard.</p>
  <p>The <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_CDN_INCLUDEITEM_cpp">
  CDN_INCLUDEITEM</MSHelp:link>
  notification message provides another way to filter the names that the dialog
  box displays. To use this message, provide an <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_OFNHookProc_cpp">
  OFNHookProc</MSHelp:link>
  hook procedure and specify the OFN_ENABLEINCLUDENOTIFY flag in the <b>OPENFILENAME</b>
  structure when you create the dialog box. Each time the user opens a folder,
  the dialog box sends a <b>CDN_INCLUDEITEM</b> notification to your hook
  procedure for each item in the newly opened folder. The return value of the
  hook procedure indicates whether the dialog box should display the item in the
  folder's item list.</p>
  <h3><a name="_win32_File_and_Directory_Validation"></a>File and Directory
  Validation</h3>
  <p>Except as noted, the information in this section applies to both
  Explorer-style and old-style <b>Open</b> and <b>Save As</b> dialog boxes.</p>
  <p>The dialog box automatically validates file names typed by the user to
  ensure that the names contain only valid characters. To override the file name
  character validation, set the OFN_NOVALIDATE flag.</p>
  <p>To force the dialog box to verify that the user specified the name of an
  existing file, set the OFN_FILEMUSTEXIST flag. To force verification that the
  specified path exists, set the OFN_PATHMUSTEXIST flag. If you set the
  OFN_CREATEPROMPT flag, the dialog box prompts the user for permission to
  create a nonexistent file. If this flag is set and the user chooses to create
  a new file, the dialog box closes, and the function returns the specified
  name. Otherwise, the dialog box remains open.</p>
  <p>When using the <b>Save As</b> dialog box, you can direct the dialog box to
  prompt the user for permission to overwrite an existing file by setting the
  OFN_OVERWRITEPROMPT flag.</p>
  <p>By default, the dialog box creates a zero-length test file to determine
  whether a new file can be created in the selected directory. To prevent the
  creation of this test file, set the OFN_NOTESTFILECREATE flag.</p>
  <p>If you enable a hook procedure, the dialog box notifies your hook procedure
  when a network sharing violation occurs for the file name specified by the
  user. If you set the OFN_EXPLORER flag, the dialog box sends the <MSHelp:link 
tabIndex=0 xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_CDN_SHAREVIOLATION_cpp">
  CDN_SHAREVIOLATION</MSHelp:link>
  message to the hook procedure. If you do not set OFN_EXPLORER, the dialog box
  sends the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_SHAREVISTRING_cpp">
  SHAREVISTRING</MSHelp:link>
  registered message to the hook procedure. To prevent the dialog box from
  sending any notifications for sharing violations, set the OFN_SHAREAWARE flag.</p>
  <p>If the user selects the read-only check box, the dialog box sets the
  OFN_READONLY flag on return. To hide the <b>Open As Read Only</b> check box,
  set the OFN_HIDEREADONLY flag. To prevent the dialog box from returning names
  of existing files that have the read-only attribute, set the
  OFN_NOREADONLYRETURN flag.</p>
  <p>To prevent the dialog box from dereferencing link files, set the
  OFN_NODEREFERENCELINKS value. In this case, the dialog box returns the name of
  the link file rather than the name of the file referenced by the link file.</p>
  <h3><a name="_win32_Open_and_Save_As_Dialog_Box_Customization"></a>Open and
  Save As Dialog Box Customization</h3>
  <p>You can customize an <b>Open</b> or <b>Save As</b> dialog box by providing
  a hook procedure, a custom template, or both. However, the Explorer-style and
  old-style versions of the dialog boxes differ in their use of custom templates
  and hook procedures.</p>

  <h3><a name="_win32_Explorer_Style_Hook_Procedures"></a>Explorer-Style Hook
  Procedures</h3>
  <p>You can customize an Explorer-style <b>Open</b> or <b>Save As</b> dialog
  box by providing a hook procedure, a custom template, or both. If you provide
  a hook procedure for an Explorer-style dialog box, the system creates a dialog
  box that is a child of the default dialog box. The hook procedure acts as the
  dialog procedure for the child dialog box. This child dialog box is based on
  the custom template, or on a default template if none is provided. For more
  information, see <a href="#_win32_Explorer_Style_Custom_Templates" target="_self">Explorer-Style
  Custom Templates</a>.</p>
  <p>To enable a hook procedure for an Explorer-style <b>Open</b> or <b>Save As</b>
  dialog box, use the <b>OPENFILENAME</b> structure when you create the dialog
  box. Set the OFN_ENABLEHOOK and OFN_EXPLORER flags in the <b>Flags</b> member
  and specify the address of an <b>OFNHookProc</b> hook procedure in the <b>lpfnHook</b>
  member. If you provide a hook procedure and omit the OFN_EXPLORER flag, you
  must use an <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_OFNHookProcOldStyle_cpp">
  OFNHookProcOldStyle</MSHelp:link>
  hook procedure and you will get the old-style user-interface. For more
  information, see <a href="#_win32_Customizing_Old_Style_Dialog_Boxes" target="_self">Customizing
  Old-Style Dialog Boxes</a>.</p>
  <p>An Explorer-style hook procedure receives a variety of messages while the
  dialog box is open. These include the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <b>WM_INITDIALOG</b> message and other standard dialog box messages
      such as the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_WM_CTLCOLORDLG_cpp">
      WM_CTLCOLORDLG</MSHelp:link>
      control color message.
    <li>A set of <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_WM_NOTIFY">
      WM_NOTIFY</MSHelp:link>
      notification messages indicating actions taken by the user or other dialog
      box events.
    <li>Messages for any additional controls that you defined by specifying a
      child dialog template.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition, there is a set of messages that you can send to an
  Explorer-style dialog box to get information or to control the behavior and
  appearance of the dialog box.</p>
  <p>If you provide a hook procedure for an Explorer-style dialog box, the
  default dialog box procedure creates a child dialog box when the default
  dialog procedure is processing its <b>WM_INITDIALOG</b> message. The hook
  procedure acts as the dialog procedure for the child dialog box. At this time,
  the hook procedure receives its own <b>WM_INITDIALOG</b> message with the <i>lParam</i>
  parameter set to the address of the <b>OPENFILENAME</b> structure used to
  initialize the dialog box. After the child dialog finishes processing its own <b>WM_INITDIALOG</b>
  message, the default dialog procedure moves the standard controls, if
  necessary, to make room for any additional controls of the child dialog box.
  The default dialog procedure then sends the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_CDN_INITDONE_cpp">
  CDN_INITDONE</MSHelp:link>
  notification message to the hook procedure.</p>
  <p>The hook procedure receives <b>WM_NOTIFY</b> notification messages
  indicating actions taken by the user in the dialog box. You can use some of
  these messages to control the behavior of the dialog box. For example, the
  hook procedure receives the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0

  <h3><a name="_win32_Explorer_Style_Custom_Templates"></a>Explorer-Style Custom
  Templates</h3>
  <p>To define additional controls for an Explorer-style <b>Open</b> or <b>Save
  As</b> dialog box, use the <b>OPENFILENAME</b> structure to specify a template
  for a child dialog box that contains the additional controls. If your child
  dialog template is a resource in an application or dynamic-link library, set
  the OFN_ENABLETEMPLATE flag in the <b>Flags</b> member and use the <b>hInstance</b>
  and <b>lpTemplateName</b> members of the structure to identify the module and
  resource name. If the template is already in memory, set the
  OFN_ENABLETEMPLATEHANDLE flag and use the <b>hInstance</b> member to identify
  the memory object that contains the template. When providing a child dialog
  template for an Explorer-style dialog box, you must also set the OFN_EXPLORER
  flag; otherwise, the system assumes you are providing a replacement template
  for an old-style dialog box. Typically, if you provide additional controls,
  you must also provide an <a href="#_win32_Explorer_Style_Hook_Procedures" target="_self">Explorer-style
  hook procedure</a> to process messages for the new controls.</p>
  <p>You can create your child dialog box template as you do any other template,
  except that you must specify the WS_CHILD and WS_CLIPSIBLINGS styles and
  should specify the DS_3DLOOK and DS_CONTROL styles. The system requires the
  WS_CHILD style because your template defines a child dialog of the default <b>Open</b>
  or <b>Save As</b> dialog box. The WS_CLIPSIBLINGS style ensures that the child
  dialog box does not paint over any of the controls in the default dialog box.
  The DS_3DLOOK style makes sure that the appearance of the controls in the
  child dialog box is consistent with the controls in the default dialog box.
  The DS_CONTROL style makes sure that the user can use the TAB and other
  navigation keys to move between all controls, default or custom, in the
  customized dialog box.</p>
  <p>To make room for the new controls, the system expands the default dialog
  box by the width and height of the custom dialog box. By default, all controls
  from the custom dialog box are positioned <i>below</i> the controls in the
  default dialog box. However, you can override this default positioning by
  including a static text control in your custom dialog box template and
  assigning it the control identifier value of stc32. (This value is defined in
  the DLG.H header file.) In this case, the system uses the control as the point
  of reference for determining where to position the new controls. All new
  controls above and to the left of the stc32 control are positioned the same
  amount above and to the left of the controls in the default dialog box. New
  controls below and to the right of the stc32 control are positioned below and
  to the right of the default controls. In general, each new control is
  positioned so that it has the same position relative to the default controls
  as it had to the stc32 control. To make room for these new controls, the
  system adds space to the left, right, bottom, and top of the default dialog
  box as needed.</p>
  <p>The system requires the hook procedure to process all messages intended for
  the custom dialog box and therefore sends the same window messages to the hook
  procedure as to any other dialog box procedure. For example, the hook
  procedure receives <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_WM_COMMAND_cpp">
  WM_COMMAND</MSHelp:link>
  messages when the user clicks on button controls in the custom dialog box. The
  hook procedure is responsible for initializing these controls and retrieving
  values from the controls when the dialog box is closed. Note that when the
  hook procedure receives the <b>WM_INITDIALOG</b> message, the system has not
  yet moved the controls to their final positions.</p>
  <p>The default dialog box procedure handles messages for all the controls in
  the default dialog box, but the hook procedure receives the notification
  messages for user actions on these controls as described in <a href="#_win32_Explorer_Style_Hook_Procedures" target="_self">Explorer-Style
  Hook Procedures</a>.</p>
  <h3><a name="_win32_Explorer_Style_Control_Identifiers"></a>Explorer-Style
  Control Identifiers</h3>
  <p>The Platform SDK provides the default dialog box template for the old-style
  dialog boxes, but does not include the default template for the Explorer-style
  dialog boxes. This is because the Explorer-style dialog boxes allow you to add
  your own controls but do not support modifying the template for the standard
  controls. However, in some cases, you may need to know the control identifiers
  used in the default templates. For example, the <b>CDM_HIDECONTROL</b> and <b>CDM_SETCONTROLTEXT</b>
  messages require a control identifier.</p>
  <p>The following table shows the identifiers of the standard controls in the
  Explorer-style <b>Open</b> and <b>Save As</b> dialog boxes. The identifiers
  are constants defined in Dlgs.h and Winuser.h.</p>

  <h3><a name="_win32_Customizing_Old_Style_Dialog_Boxes"></a>Customizing
  Old-Style Dialog Boxes</h3>
  <p>You can customize an old-style <b>Open</b> or <b>Save As</b> dialog box by
  providing an <b>OFNHookProcOldStyle</b> hook procedure that receives messages
  or notifications intended for the default dialog box procedure. You can also
  provide a custom template to use in place of the default template. The hook
  procedures and templates used with the old-style dialog boxes are similar to
  those used with the other common dialog boxes. For more information, see <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_Customizing_Common_Dialog_Boxes">
  Hook Procedures for Common Dialog Boxes</MSHelp:link>
  and <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_Customizing_Common_Dialog_Boxes">
  Custom Templates</MSHelp:link>
  .</p>
  <p>To enable a hook procedure for an old-style <b>Open</b> or <b>Save As</b>
  dialog box, use the <b>OPENFILENAME</b> structure when you create the dialog
  box. Set the OFN_ENABLEHOOK flag in the <b>Flags</b> member and specify the
  address of an <b>OFNHookProcOldStyle</b> hook procedure in the <b>lpfnHook</b>
  member. The dialog box procedure sends a <b>WM_INITDIALOG</b> message to the
  hook procedure with the <i>Param</i> parameter set to the address of the <b>OPENFILENAME</b>
  structure used to initialize the dialog box.</p>
  <p>You can use the <b>OPENFILENAME</b> structure to specify a custom template
  for the <b>Open</b> or <b>Save As</b> dialog box to use in place of the
  default template. If your custom template is a resource in an application or
  dynamic-link library, set the OFN_ENABLETEMPLATE flag in the <b>Flags</b>
  member and use the <b>hInstance</b> and <b>lpTemplateName</b> members of the
  structure to identify the module and resource name. If your custom template is
  already in memory, set the OFN_ENABLETEMPLATEHANDLE flag and use the <b>hInstance</b>
  member to identify the memory object that contains the template. Create the
  custom template by modifying the default template specified in the
  Fileopen.dlg file. The control identifiers used in the default Find and
  Replace dialog templates are defined in the Dlgs.h file.</p>
  <p>By default, the <b>GetOpenFileName</b> and <b>GetSaveFileName</b> functions
  display the Explorer-style dialog boxes. If you want to display an old-style
  dialog box, you must provide an <b>OFNHookProcOldStyle</b> hook procedure and
  ensure that the OFN_EXPLORER flag is not set in the <b>Flags</b> member of the
  <b>OPENFILENAME</b> structure.</p>
  <p>If you set the OFN_EXPLORER flag, the system treats a hook procedure or
  custom template as an Explorer-style customization. For information about
  customizing an Explorer-style dialog box, see <a href="#_win32_Explorer_Style_Custom_Templates" target="_self">Explorer-Style
  Custom Templates</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3><a name="example"></a>Example</h3>
<p>This example describes sample code that displays an <b>Open</b> dialog box so
a user can specify the drive, directory, and name of a file to open. The sample
code first initializes an <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_OPENFILENAME_str_cpp">
OPENFILENAME</MSHelp:link>
 structure, and then calls the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_GetOpenFileName_cpp">
GetOpenFileName</MSHelp:link>
 function to display the dialog box.</p>
<p>In this example, the <b>lpstrFilter</b> member is a pointer to a buffer that
specifies two file name filters that the user can select to limit the file names
that are displayed. The buffer contains a double-null terminated array of
strings in which each pair of strings specifies a filter. The <b>nFilterIndex</b>
member specifies that the first pattern is used when the dialog box is created.</p>
<p>This example sets the OFN_PATHMUSTEXIST and OFN_FILEMUSTEXIST flags in the <b>Flags</b>
member. These flags cause the dialog box to verify, before returning, that the
path and file name specified by the user actually exist.</p>
<p>The <b>GetOpenFileName</b> function returns TRUE if the user clicks the <b>OK</b>
button and the specified path and file name exist. In this case, the buffer
pointed to by the <b>lpstrFile</b> member contains the path and file name. The
sample code uses this information in a call to the function to open the file.</p>
<p>Although this example does not set the OFN_EXPLORER flag, it still displays
the default Explorer-style <b>Open</b> dialog box. However, if you want to
provide a hook procedure or a custom template and you want the Explorer user
interface, you must set the OFN_EXPLORER flag. Note, in the C programming
language, a string enclosed in double quotes is null-terminated.</p>
