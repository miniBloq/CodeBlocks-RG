<h2>About Scroll Bars</h2>
<hr SIZE="1">
A window can display a data object, such as a document or a bitmap, that is
larger than the window's client area. When provided with a scroll bar, the user
can scroll a data object in the client area to bring into view the portions of
the object that extend beyond the borders of the window.
<p>Microsoft® Internet Explorer 4.0 introduces a new control called a <i>flat
scroll bar</i>. Functionally, flat scroll bars behave just like standard scroll
bars. The difference is that you can customize the appearance of flat scroll
bars to a greater extent than standard scroll bars.</p>
<p>Scroll bars should be included in any window for which the content of the
client area extends beyond the window's borders. A scroll bar's orientation
determines the direction in which scrolling occurs when the user operates the
scroll bar. A horizontal scroll bar enables the user to scroll the content of a
window to the left or right. A vertical scroll bar enables the user to scroll
the content up or down.</p>

<h3><a name="parts_of_scroll_bar"></a>Parts of a Scroll Bar</h3>
<p>A scroll bar consists of a shaded shaft with an arrow button at each end and
a <i>scroll box</i> (sometimes called a thumb) between the arrow buttons. A
scroll bar represents the overall length or width of a data object in a window's
client area; the scroll box represents the portion of the object that is visible
in the client area. The position of the scroll box changes whenever the user
scrolls a data object to display a different portion of it. The system also
adjusts the size of a scroll bar's scroll box so that it indicates what portion
of the entire data object is currently visible in the window. If most of the
object is visible, the scroll box occupies most of the scroll bar's shaft.
Similarly, if only a small portion of the object is visible, the scroll box
occupies a small part of the shaft.</p>
<p>The user scrolls the content of a window by clicking one of the arrow
buttons, by clicking the area in the shaded shaft, or by dragging the scroll
box. When the user clicks an arrow button, the application scrolls the content
by one unit (typically a single line or column). When the user clicks the shaded
areas, the application scrolls the content by one window. The amount of
scrolling that occurs when the user drags the scroll box depends on the distance
the user drags the scroll box and on the scrolling range of the scroll bar. For
more information about the scrolling range, see <a href="#scroll_position_and_range" target="_self">Scroll
Box Position and Scrolling Range</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="standard_scroll_bars"></a>Standard Scroll Bars and Scroll Bar
Controls</h3>
<p>A scroll bar is included in a window either as a standard scroll bar or as a
scroll bar control. A standard scroll bar is located in the nonclient area of a
window. It is created with the window and displayed when the window is
displayed. The sole purpose of a standard scroll bar is to enable the user to
generate scrolling requests for viewing the entire content of the client area.
You can include a standard scroll bar in a window by specifying WS_HSCROLL,
WS_VSCROLL, or both styles when you create the window. The WS_HSCROLL style
creates a horizontal scroll bar positioned at the bottom of the client area. The
WS_VSCROLL style creates a vertical scroll bar positioned at the right of the
client area. The SM_CXHSCROLL and SM_CYHSCROLL system metric values define the
width and height of a standard horizontal scroll bar. The SM_CXVSCROLL and
SM_CYVSCROLL values define the width and height of a standard vertical scroll
bar. A standard scroll bar is part of its associated window and therefore does
not have a window handle of its own.</p>
<p>A scroll bar control is a control window that belongs to the SCROLLBAR window
class. A scroll bar control appears and functions like a standard scroll bar,
but it is a separate window. As a separate window, a scroll bar control receives
direct input focus, indicated by a flashing caret displayed in the scroll box.
Unlike a standard scroll bar, a scroll bar control also has a built-in keyboard
interface that enables the user to direct scrolling. You can use as many scroll
bar controls as needed in a single window. When you create a scroll bar control,
you must specify the scroll bar's size and position. However, if a scroll bar
control's window can be resized, adjustments to the scroll bar's size must be
made whenever the size of the window changes.</p>
<p>The advantage of using a standard scroll bar is that the system creates the
scroll bar and automatically sets its size and position. However, standard
scroll bars are sometimes too restrictive. For example, suppose that you want to
divide a client area into quadrants and use a separate set of scroll bars to
control the content of each quadrant. You cannot use standard scroll bars
because you can only create one set of scroll bars for a particular window. Use
scroll bar controls instead, because you can add as many of them to a window as
you want.</p>
<p>Applications can provide scroll bar controls for purposes other than
scrolling the content of a window. For example, a screen saver application might
provide a scroll bar for setting the speed at which graphics are moved about on
the screen.</p>
<p>A scroll bar control can have a number of styles that serves to control the
orientation and position of the scroll bar. You specify the styles that you want
when you call the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_CreateWindowEx">
CreateWindowEx</MSHelp:link>
 function to create a scroll bar control. Some of the styles create a scroll bar
control that uses a default width or height. However, you must always specify
the x- and y-coordinates and the other dimensions of the scroll bar.</p>
<p>For a table of scroll bar control styles, see <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0

<div class="clsNote">
  <b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; To use visual styles with scroll bars, an application

<h3><a name="scroll_position_and_range"></a>Scroll Box Position and Scrolling
Range</h3>
<p>The position of the scroll box is represented as an integer; it is relative
to the left or upper end of the scroll bar, depending on whether the scroll bar
is horizontal or vertical. The position must be within the minimum and maximum
values of the scrolling range. For example, in a scroll bar with a range of 0
through 100, position 50 is in the middle, with the remaining positions
distributed equally along the scroll bar. The initial range depends on the
scroll bar. Standard scroll bars have an initial range of 0 through 100; scroll
bar controls have an empty range (both minimum and maximum values are zero),
unless you supply an explicit range when the control is created. You can change
the range at any time. You can use the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_SetScrollInfo_cpp">
SetScrollInfo</MSHelp:link>
 function to set the range values, and the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_GetScrollInfo_cpp">
GetScrollInfo</MSHelp:link>
 function to retrieve the current range values.</p>
<p>An application typically adjusts the scroll range to convenient integers,
making it easy to translate the scroll box position into a value corresponding
to the data object to be scrolled. For example, if an application must display
260 lines of a text file in a window that can show only 16 lines at a time, the
vertical scroll bar range can be set to 1 through 244. If the scroll box is at
position 1, the first line will be at the top of the window. If the scroll box
is at position 244, the last line (line 260) will be at the bottom of the
window. If an application attempts to specify a position value that is less than
the minimum or more than the maximum, the minimum or maximum scrolling range
value is used instead.</p>
<p>You can set a page size for a scroll bar. The <i>page size</i> represents the
number of data units that can fit in the client area of the owner window given
its current size. For example, if the client area can hold 16 lines of text, an
application would set the page size to 16. The system uses the page size, along
with the scrolling range and length of the scroll shaft, to set the size of the
scroll box. Whenever a window containing a scroll bar is resized, an application
should call the <b>SetScrollInfo</b> function to set the page size. An
application can retrieve the current page size by calling the sending <b>GetScrollInfo</b>
function.</p>
<p>To establish a useful relationship between the scroll bar range and the data
object, an application must adjust the range whenever the size of the data
object changes.</p>
<p>As the user moves the scroll box in a scroll bar, the scroll bar reports the
scroll box position as an integer in the scrolling range. If the position is the
minimum value, the scroll box is at the top of a vertical scroll bar or at the
left end of a horizontal scroll bar. If the position is the maximum value, the
scroll box is at the bottom of a vertical scroll bar or at right end of a
horizontal scroll bar.</p>
<p>The maximum value that a scroll bar can report (that is, the maximum
scrolling position) depends on the page size. If the scroll bar has a page size
greater than one, the maximum scrolling position is less than the maximum range
value. You can use the following formula to calculate the maximum scrolling
position:</p>
<pre class="clsCode" AUTOHILITE="1">MaxScrollPos = MaxRangeValue - (PageSize - 1) </pre>
<p>An application must move the scroll box in a scroll bar. Although the user
makes a request for scrolling in a scroll bar, the scroll bar does not
automatically update the scroll box position. Instead, it passes the request to
the parent window, which must scroll the data and update the scroll box
position. An application uses the <b>SetScrollInfo</b> function to update the
scroll box position; otherwise, it uses the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_SetScrollPos_cpp">
SetScrollPos</MSHelp:link>
 function. Because it controls the scroll box movement, the application can move
the scroll box in increments that work best for the data being scrolled.</p>
<h3><a name="scroll_bar_visibility"></a>Scroll Bar Visibility</h3>
<p>The system hides and disables a standard scroll bar when equal minimum and
maximum values are specified. The system also hides and disables a standard
scroll bar if you specify a page size that includes the entire scroll range of
the scroll bar. This is the way to temporarily hide a scroll bar when it is not
needed for the content of the client area. There is no need to make scrolling
requests through the scroll bar when it is hidden. The system enables the scroll
bar and shows it again when you set the minimum and maximum values to unequal
values or when the page size that does not include the entire scroll range. The <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_ShowScrollBar_cpp">
ShowScrollBar</MSHelp:link>
 function can also be used to hide or show a scroll bar. It does not affect the
scroll bar's range, page size, or scroll box position.</p>
<p>The <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_EnableScrollBar_cpp">
EnableScrollBar</MSHelp:link>
 function can be used to disable one or both arrows of a scroll bar. An
application displays disabled arrows in gray and does not respond to user input.</p>
<h3><a name="scroll_bar_requests"></a>Scroll Bar Requests</h3>
<p>The user makes scrolling requests by clicking various parts of a scroll bar.
The system sends the request to the specified window in the form of a <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_WM_HSCROLL_cpp">
WM_HSCROLL</MSHelp:link>
 or <MSHelp:link 
tabIndex=0 xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_WM_VSCROLL_cpp">
WM_VSCROLL</MSHelp:link>
 message. A horizontal scroll bar sends the <b>WM_HSCROLL</b> message; a
vertical scroll bar sends the <b>WM_VSCROLL</b> message. Each message includes a
request code that corresponds to the user's action, to the handle to the scroll
bar (scroll bar controls only), and, in some cases, to the position of the
scroll box.</p>
<p>The following figure shows the request code that the user generates when
clicking various parts of a scroll bar.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="scroll11.gif" width="403" height="246"></p>
<p>The SB_ values specify the action the user takes. An application examines the
codes that accompany the <b>WM_HSCROLL</b> and <b>WM_VSCROLL</b> messages and
then performs the appropriate scrolling operation. In the following table, the
user's action is specified for each value, followed by the application's
response. In each case, a unit is defined by the application as appropriate for
the data. For example, the typical unit for scrolling text vertically is a line
of text.</p>

</table>
<p>A scroll bar generates SB_THUMBPOSITION and SB_THUMBTRACK request code when
the user clicks and drags the scroll box. An application should be programmed to
process either the SB_THUMBTRACK or SB_THUMBPOSITION request code.</p>
<p>The SB_THUMBPOSITION request code occurs when the user releases the mouse
button after clicking the scroll box. An application that processes this message
performs the scrolling operation after the user has dragged the scroll box to
the desired position and released the mouse button.</p>
<p>The SB_THUMBTRACK request code occurs as the user drags the scroll box. If an
application processes SB_THUMBTRACK request codes, it can scroll the content of
a window as the user drags the scroll box. However, a scroll bar can generate
many SB_THUMBTRACK request code in a short period, so an application should
process these request codes only if it can quickly repaint the content of the
window.</p>
<h3><a name="keyboards_and_scroll_bars"></a>Keyboard Interface for a Scroll Bar</h3>
<p>A scroll bar control provides a built-in keyboard interface that enables the
user to issue scrolling requests by using the keyboard; a standard scroll bar
does not. When a scroll bar control has the keyboard focus, it sends <b>WM_HSCROLL</b>
and <b>WM_VSCROLL</b> messages to its parent window when the user presses the
arrow keys. The request code is sent with each message corresponding to the
arrow key the user has pressed. Following are the arrow keys and their
corresponding request codes.</p>
<table class="clsStd">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Arrow key</th>

<div class="clsNote">
  <b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The keyboard interface of a scroll bar control sends
  the SB_TOP and SB_BOTTOM request codes. The SB_TOP request code indicates that
  the user has reached the top value of the scrolling range. An application
  scrolls the window content downward so that the top of the data object is
  visible. The SB_BOTTOM request code indicates that the user has reached the
  bottom value of the scrolling range. If an application processes the SB_BOTTOM
  request code, it scrolls the window content upward so that the bottom of the
  data object is visible.
</div>
<p>If you want a keyboard interface for a standard scroll bar, you can create
one yourself by processing the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_wm_keydown">
WM_KEYDOWN</MSHelp:link>
 message in your window procedure and then performing the appropriate scrolling
action based on the virtual-key code that accompanies the message. For
information about how to create a keyboard interface for a scroll bar, see <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0

.</p>
<h3><a name="scrolling_the_client_area"></a>Scrolling the Client Area</h3>
<p>The simplest way to scroll the content of a client area is to erase and then
redraw it. This is the method an application is likely to use with SB_PAGEUP,
SB_PAGEDOWN, and SB_TOP request codes, which typically require completely new
content.</p>
<p>For some request codes, such as SB_LINEUP and SB_LINEDOWN, not all the
content need be erased, because some remains visible after scrolling occurs. The
<MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_ScrollWindowEx_cpp">
ScrollWindowEx</MSHelp:link>
 function preserves a portion of the client area's content, move the preserved
portion a specified amount, and then prepares the rest of the client area for
painting new information. <b>ScrollWindowEx</b> uses the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_BitBlt">
BitBlt</MSHelp:link>
 function to move a specific part of the data object to a new location within
the client area. Any uncovered part of the client area (anything not preserved)
is invalidated, erased, and painted when the next <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_wm_paint">
WM_PAINT</MSHelp:link>
 message occurs.</p>
<p>The <b>ScrollWindowEx</b> function can be used to exclude a portion of the
client area from the scrolling operation. This keeps items with fixed positions,
such as child windows, from moving within the client area. It automatically
invalidates the portion of the client area that is to receive the new
information, so the application does not have to compute its own clipping
regions. For more information on clipping, see <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_Clipping">
Clipping</MSHelp:link>
.</p>
<p>Usually an application scrolls the content of a window in the direction
opposite that indicated by the scroll bar. For example, when the user clicks the
shaft in the area below the scroll box, an application scrolls the object in the
window upward to reveal a portion of the object that is below the visible
portion.</p>
<p>You can also scroll a rectangular region using the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_ScrollDC_cpp">
ScrollDC</MSHelp:link>
 function.</p>
<h3><a name="scroll_colors_and_metrics"></a>Scroll Bar Colors and Metrics</h3>
<p>The system-defined color value, COLOR_SCROLLBAR, controls the color within a
scroll bar's shaft. Use the <MSHelp:link tabIndex=0 
xmlns:MSHelp="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mshelp" 
keywords="_win32_getsyscolor">
