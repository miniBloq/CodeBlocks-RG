<h3><a name="_Toc494631980">Owner-Drawn Buttons</a></h3>
<p>Unlike radio buttons, an <i>owner-drawn button</i> is painted by the
application, not by the system, and has no predefined appearance or usage. Its
purpose is to provide a button whose appearance and behavior are defined by the
application alone. There is only one owner-drawn button style: BS_OWNERDRAW.</p>
<p>When the user selects an owner-drawn button, the system sends the button's
parent window a <a href="../../api/api2/menus_8wh0.htm"><b>WM_COMMAND</b></a>
message containing the <a href="../../api/api2/buttons_8810.htm"><b>BN_CLICKED</b></a>
notification code, just as it does for a button that is not owner-drawn. The
application must respond appropriately.</p>
<p>For an example of an owner-drawn button, see <a href="../../api/api2/buttons_4icz.htm">Using
Owner-Drawn Buttons</a>.</p>
