<h2 align="left">Adding controls to the dialog</h2>
<p align="left">The list of the controls appears when you press the <img border="0" src="editor3.gif" width="25" height="25">
symbol at the left of the horizontal toolbar.</p>
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="23%"><img border="0" src="editor4.gif" width="125" height="572"></td>
    <td width="77%" valign="top">To add a control to the dialog box you click
      once in the control you want to add, then you move the mouse to the
      position in the dialog box where you want it to appear. 
      <p>You will notice that the cursor changes its shape when you it enters
      the dialog box, indicating you (roughly) the dimensions of the new
      control.</p>
      <p>You click once at the point where you want the new control to be shown.
      It is not very important to be really accurate since you can move it
      later.</p>
      <p>You can change the most important properties of a control (its symbolic
      name and its asociated text) by entering directly those parameters in the
      controls at the top of the editor. To enter the name you use the control
      at the top left, to enter the text you use the edit control in the middle.</p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="editor5.gif" width="499" height="65"></p>
      <p align="left">Note that the coordinates of the new control appear in the
      status bar at the bottom of the editor.</p>
      <p align="left">To add another control, just select (with one click)
      another in the list. Note that the controls window can be dettached and
      made floating by selecting the &quot;Keep open&quot; option at the bottom.
      </p>
      <p align="left">To revert to normal operation (control window hidden) just
      close it.</p>
