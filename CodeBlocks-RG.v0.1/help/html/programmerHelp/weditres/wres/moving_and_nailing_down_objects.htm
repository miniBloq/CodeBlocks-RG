<h2 align="left">Moving and nailing down objects</h2>
<p align="left">You can move the selection by pressing the left mouse button
down somewhere in the middle of it and holding the button pressed for a certain
time (less that a second). This will change the form of the mouse to a hand. You
can then move the selection by moving the mouse. </p>
<p align="left">When the mouse is not precise enough, you can finely move the
controls one unit at a time using the arrows in the keyboard.</p>
<p align="left">You can fix an object in one or two directions by using the <img border="0" src="editor10.gif" width="29" height="26">
tool. You click in that tool, then you click in one of the 8 handles. The
control will be fixed in the line that intersects that handle. This is useful
for avoiding moving controls by chance.</p>
<p align="left">A fixed control handle changes its color to blue.</p>
