<h2 align="left">Managing the selection</h2>
<p align="left">At any time there is always a selected control, the one you are
working with. It is distinguished by eight red rectangles that allow you to
resize it in all directions.</p>
<p align="left">The selection can be more than just one control. This is useful
for aligning a set of controls. Suppose this situation:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="editor6.gif" width="366" height="178"></p>
<p align="left">Here, we have one control selected. To align the three text
fields, you click in a second control (in this case &quot;Text2&quot;) holding
pressed the SHIFT key. This indicates the editor that you do not want to select
a new object but to extend the selection to include both objects. You will see a
display similar to this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="editor7.gif" width="366" height="178"></p>
<p align="left">The second (most recently selected control) has 8 full red
handles, and the other has 8 empty handles, meaning it is seleted, but no
longuer the &quot;dominant&quot; control.</p>
<p align="left">To align the two controls you just press the alignment buttons
at the top of the editor. For instance if you want the editor to align the
controls using the left margin you press the button <img border="0" src="editor8.gif" width="27" height="26">
that as avertical bar at the left side. This will produce a display like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="editor9.gif" width="366" height="178"></p>
<p align="left">Note that the editor moved the &quot;Text3&quot; control to the
position of the dominant control &quot;Text2&quot;, that has the full red
handles. This is a general principle that applies to selections of several
controls, not only two.</p>
<p align="left">When you have several controls selected, clicking in a selected
control and holding the SHIFT key will deselect the control. You can change the
dominant control by clicking on any of the selected controls (without any SHIFT
key).</p>
<p align="left">Note that the coordinates shown in the status bar are the
coordinates of the whole selection.</p>
