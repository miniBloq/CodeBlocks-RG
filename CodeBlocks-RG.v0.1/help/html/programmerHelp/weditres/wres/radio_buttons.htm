<h2>Radio buttons</h2>
<p>A <i>radio button</i> consists of a round button and application-defined text
(a label), an icon, or a bitmap that indicates a choice the user can make by
selecting the button. An application typically uses radio buttons in a group box
to permit the user to choose from a set of related, but mutually exclusive
options. For example, the application might present a group of radio buttons
from which the user can select a format preference for text selected in the
client area. The user could select a left-aligned, right-aligned, or centered
format by selecting the corresponding radio button. Typically, the user can
select only one option at a time from a set of radio buttons.</p>
<p>A radio button can be one of two styles: standard or automatic, as defined by
the constants BS_RADIOBUTTON and BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON. Each style can assume two
check states: checked (a dot in the button) or cleared (no dot in the button).
Repeatedly selecting a radio button (standard or automatic) toggles it from
checked to cleared and back again.</p>
<p>When the user selects either state, the radio button receives the keyboard
focus. The system sends the button's parent window a <b>WM_COMMAND</b> message
containing the <b>BN_CLICKED</b> notification code. The parent window doesn't
acknowledge this message if it comes from an automatic radio button because the
system automatically sets the check state for that style. But the parent window
should acknowledge the message if it comes from a radio button because the
parent window is responsible for setting the check state for that style.
Regardless of the radio button style, the system automatically repaints the
button as its state changes.</p>
<p>Styles</p>
<p>Normally, radio buttons look like this: <img border="0" src="radio_9.gif" width="61" height="26"></p>
<p>If you select the &quot;Flat&quot; style, they will look like this: <img border="0" src="radio_10.gif" width="63" height="23"></p>
<p>Similarly to check boxes, they can be made to appear like push buttons: <img border="0" src="radio_11.gif" width="69" height="30"></p>
<p>This styles can be combined, for instance to have a flat, push like radio
button.</p>
