<h2><a name="_Toc494631964">The Windows User Interface</a></h2>
<p>The user interface functions give applications the means to create and manage
a user interface. You use these functions to create and use windows to display
output, prompt for user input, and carry out the other tasks necessary to
support interaction with the user. Most applications create at least one window.</p>
<p>Applications define the general behavior and appearance of their windows by
creating window classes and corresponding window procedures. A window class
identifies default characteristics such as whether the window processes mouse
button clicks or has a menu. The corresponding window procedure contains code
that defines the behavior of the window, carries out requested tasks, and
processes user input.</p>
<p>Applications generate output for a window by using the GDI functions. Because
all windows share the display screen, applications do not receive access to the
entire screen. Instead, the system aligns and clips all output to fit within the
corresponding window. Applications can draw in a window in response to a request
from the system or while processing input messages. When the size or position of
a window changes, the system typically sends a message to the application
requesting that it paint any previously unexposed area of its window.</p>
<p>Applications receive mouse and keyboard input in the form of messages. The
system translates mouse movement, mouse button clicks, and keystrokes into input
messages and places these messages in the message queue for the application. The
system automatically provides a queue for each application. The application uses
message functions to extract messages from the queue and dispatch them to the
appropriate window procedure for processing.</p>
<p>Applications can process the mouse and keyboard input directly or let the
system translate this low-level input into command messages by using menus and
keyboard accelerators. You use menus to present a list of commands to the user.
The system manages all actions required to let the user choose a command and
then sends a message to the window identifying the choice. Keyboard accelerators
are application-defined combinations of keystrokes that the system translates
into messages. Accelerators typically correspond to commands in a menu and
generate the same messages.</p>
<p>Applications often respond to command messages by prompting the user for
additional information with dialog boxes. A dialog box is a temporary window
that displays information or requests input. A dialog box typically includes
controls — small, single-purpose windows — that represent buttons and boxes
through which the user provides information. There are controls for typing text,
scrolling text, selecting items from a list of items, and so on. Dialog boxes
manage and process the input from these controls, making this information
available to the application so that it can complete the requested command.</p>
<p>You can share useful data, such as bitmaps, icons, fonts, and strings, by
adding this data as &quot;resources&quot; to the file for an application or DLL.
Applications retrieve the data by using the resource functions to locate the
resources and load them into memory.</p>
<p>Window management functions provide other features related to windows, such
as carets, the clipboard, cursors, hooks, icons, and menus.</p>
