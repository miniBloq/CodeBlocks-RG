<title>Importing a foreign library</title>

<h2>Importing a foreign library</h2>
<p>The format of the import libraries of lcc-win32 differs from the Microsoft
format. You can convert an import library by using this option in the
&quot;Utils&quot; menu of Wedit.</p>
<p>In the dialog box you should enter the name of the source library and the
name of the output library (the one with the lcc-win32 format).</p>
<p>This process is executed by the utility pedump. The editor starts</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">pedump /exp &lt;input lib&gt;</font></p>
<p>This produces an ascii list of exports in the same format as the .exp files
that are stored in your \lcc\buildlib directory. This list is passed then to the
&quot;buildlib&quot; utility that builds a library to the lcc-win32 format that
will be understood by the linker lcclnk. This is equivalent to</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">buildlib input.exp output.lib</font></p>
<p>It is better to store the library in the \lcc\lib directory to avoid path
problems.</p>
<p>Note that all this is for <b>import</b> libraries, i.e. libraries that allow
you to link with a DLL. For other types of libraries this process will not work,
because in general, it is not possible to run object code compiled for another
run time environment and with other run time structure.</p>
