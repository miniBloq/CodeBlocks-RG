<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:skip">&nbsp;This utility reads an ASCII
description of symbols and produces an import library that allows you to link
your executable with a specific DLL.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:skip">It has no command line options and
the input arguments are as follows:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:skip"><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;buildlib
&lt;ASCII description&gt; &lt;output library&gt;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:skip">&nbsp;The first argument has to be a
text file that contains the list of symbols to be built into the library; the
second argument is the name of the library.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:skip">&nbsp;Normally, the extension used in
lcc-win32 for this textual description is .exp. See the directory \lcc\buildlib
for numerous examples of these file types.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:skip">&nbsp;The format of the text file is
as follows:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:skip">&nbsp;First line: Name of the DLL
this import library should bind to. This is mandatory.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:skip">All other lines have a column format
with 1 mandatory column and two optional columns.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:skip">&nbsp;The first column should contain
the symbol name as emitted by the compiler, i.e., with all decorations, such as
leading underscore, and '@nn' decoration for _stdcall symbols.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:skip">&nbsp;The second column is optional.
It indicates the name of the symbol as it is exported from the DLL. This can be
different from the decorated form.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For
example, you may want to export a function without any decorations so that you
can your DLL in other environments. If you omit this column, buildlib will strip
decorations from the symbol names.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:skip">&nbsp;The third column is also
optional, consisting of a single keyword 'data'. If present, this means that the
exported symbol is not a function, but a data item, i.e., a variable.</p>
