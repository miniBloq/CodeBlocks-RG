<h2>Function declaration</h2>
<p>A declaration of a function specifies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The return type of the function</li>
  <li>Its name</li>
  <li>The types of each argument</li>
</ul>
<p>The general form is:</p>
</font>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">&lt;type&gt; &lt;Name&gt;<b>(</b>&lt;type
of arg 1&gt;, … &lt;type of arg N&gt; <b>)</b> ;</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">double sqrt(double) ;</font></p>
<font FACE="Arial">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note that an identifier can be added to the declaration but
its presence is optional. We can write:</p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Courier New" size="2">double sqrt(double x);</font></p>
<font FACE="Arial">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">if we want to, but the &quot;x&quot; is not required and will
be ignored by the compiler.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Functions can have a variable number of arguments. The
function &quot;printf&quot; is an example of a function that takes several
arguments. We declare those functions like this:</p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Courier New" size="2">int printf(char *, ...);</font></p>
<font FACE="Arial">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ellipsis means &quot;some more arguments&quot;.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why function declarations are important?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I started programming in C, prototypes for functions
didn’t exist. So you could define a function like this:</p>
</font>
<dl>
  <div align="justify">
    <dt><font face="Courier New" size="2">int fn(int a)</font></dt>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <dt><font face="Courier New" size="2">{</font></dt>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <dt><font face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return a+8;</font></dt>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <dt><font face="Courier New" size="2">}</font></dt>
  </div>
</dl>
<font FACE="Arial">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">and in another module write:</p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Courier New" size="2">fn(7,9);</font></p>
<font FACE="Arial">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">without any problems.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well, without any problems at compile time of course. The
program crashed or returned nonsense results. When you had a big system of many
modules written by several people, the probability that an error like this
existed in the program was almost 100%. It is impossible to avoid mistakes like
this. You can avoid them most of the time, but it is impossible to avoid them
always.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Function prototypes introduced compile time checking of all
function calls. There wasn’t anymore this dreaded problem that took us so many
debugging hours with the primitive debuggers of that time. In the C++ language,
the compiler will abort compilation if a function is used without prototypes. I
have thought many times to introduce that into lcc-win32, because ignoring the
function prototype is always an error. But, for compatibility reasons I haven’t
done it yet. <a href="#[35]">[35]</a></p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><font color="#0000FF"><a name="[34]">[34]</a></font>
The interface for using functions with a variable number of arguments is
described in the standard header file &quot;stdarg.h&quot;. See too </font><a HREF="Functions_with_variable_number_of_arguments.htm"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">functions
with variable number of arguments</font></a></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><a name="[35]"><font color="#0000FF">[35]</font></a>
There is a strong commitment, from the part of the compiler writers, to maintain
the code that was written in the language, and to avoid destroying programs that
are working. When the standards committee proposed the prototypes, all C code
wasn’t using them yet, so a transition period was set up. Compilers would
accept the old declarations without prototypes and just emit a warning. Some
people say that this period should be over by now (it is more than 10 years that
we have prototypes already), but still, new compilers like lcc-win32 are
supporting old style declarations.</font></p>
