<p class="MsoNormal">It is important when you debug windowed programs that the
debugger not interfere with the window of the program being debugged. Any
interference of the debugger with your program’s window will trigger a message
to your program, which could cause procedures to be called up that will change
the execution of the program. For instance, if you try to debug the procedure
that is called up when a <span style="font-family:Courier">WM_PAINT</span>
message is received, the fact that the debugger will pop up and hide a portion
of your program’s window, will trigger the function you want to debug to be
called up again. If you have a breakpoint in it, there is no way to escape an
endless cascade of the same message. This can be stopped either by erasing the
breakpoint or by moving the window so that the debugger’s window does not
touch the window of your program.</p>
