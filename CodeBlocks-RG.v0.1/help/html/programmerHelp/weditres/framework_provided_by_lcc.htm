<h2>Framework description</h2>

<p>The framework provided by lcc-win32 centers about providing a simple
interface for calling all the functions associated with a certain control. The
general syntax for using this objects is:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">object-&gt;Method(arguments)</font></p>
<p>This is a short hand for the normmaly used C syntax, that has ben simplified.
In strict C you woould be required to write:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">object-&gt;lpVtbl-&gt;Method(object,arguments);</font></p>
<p>The framework generates basically a file called <font face="Courier New">&lt;</font>project-name<font face="Courier New">&gt;_gen.c</font>,
where it writes all dialog box procedures for your forms. The framework will
generate code to handle all messages you are interested in, and also the code
necessary to call your callback procedures when it detects a message that you
have marked as interesting.</p>
<p>Usage:</p>
<p>The objects are created with specific creation procedures. For instance you
create a new dialog box object by calling:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">ST_DIALOGBOX *NewST_dialogbox(HWND);</font></p>
<p>This procedures will be called automatically by the code generated by the
framework. You can suppose that when your callback is being called, the objects
you receive are created already ad fully initialized and ready to use.</p>
<p>The overall picture then, looks like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You draw your dialog box in the resource editor</li>
  <li>You check the events you are interested in.</li>
  <li>You write the procedures (callbacks) that the framework will call when
    those events arrive.</li>
</ul>
