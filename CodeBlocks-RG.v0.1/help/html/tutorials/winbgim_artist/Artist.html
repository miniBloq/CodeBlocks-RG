<p class="abstract">Several features of C++ improve on C.
The "Artist" example uses two such features: object-orientation and
dynamic collections (The dynamic collections are part of the Standard
Templates Library, the STL).</p>
<p class="abstract">. Some programming tasks are much
easier to perform using classes and inheritance, the essential tools of
object orientation. This is because the program situation (the problem
domain) is naturally object-oriented. The program "Shapes" is an
example of this. <br />
. Dynamic collections (also called "containers") are storage spaces,
just like arrays are storage spaces. Unlike arrays, dynamic collections
can grow indefinitely as the program runs (as long as there is still
some memory available). That's why they are called "dynamic". "Artist",
uses a "vector", one type of dynamic collection, to store an indefinite
number of shapes.</p>
<p class="abstract">The program allows the creation of
artistic screens composed of many coloured shapes drawn on top of each
other.<br />
- A variety of basic shapes are created and displayed one by one by
pressing different keys. Once created each shape is stored into a
sequential collection (a vector).<br />
- All shapes in the collection can be drawn sequentially (on top of
each other) at any time to give a colourful composition.<br />
- At any time more shapes may be added, or the vector can be emptied
and all shapes wiped off the screen.<span class="style34"><br />
</span><br />
As we build "Artist" and see how the program works, we also learn how
to build object-oriented C++ projects composed of several classes. We
discover the advantages of class inheritance. We learn how to use
vectors and the STL, We also see how to use WinBGIm, a simple library
of 2D graphics functions. </p>
<p class="abstract">Shapes is a deceptively simple C++
program. It would be MUCH!! harder to implement in C without
object-orientation. However to be able to design and write such "simple
magic" ourselves, we have to understand key concepts of object
orientation expressed in the weird and wonderful terms below.</p>

<hr />
<h2> Before we start</h2>
<p>Create a "<em>Artist</em>" subdirectory somewhere
you choose to build this example. </p>
<p>Get the example from the zip file:<a href="ArtistForWinBGIm.zip">
<img src="smallOutput.png" alt="image: files" align="middle" border="0" height="126" width="161" />
ArtistForWinBGIm.zip</a> </p>
<p>Save the archive into the new "<em>Artist</em>"
subdirectory, and extract the source files from the archive.<br />
___________ </p>
<h2>Creating the "Shapes" project </h2>
<p>With Code::Blocks, create a new WinBGIm project in
the new "shapes" directory. Call the project <em><code>Artist</code></em>.<br />
In the project "management" screen, right-click on the project name and
select [Add files...]. Select and add all the ".cpp" and ".h" files to
the project.</p>
<p> It shows 3 <code>.cpp</code> files <code>shapes.cpp</code>,
<code>Box.cpp</code> and <code>Ellipse.cpp</code>,
but there is more to this
project than meets the eye:</p>
<p> There are 4 class header files in the project directory: <code>Shape.h</code>,
<code>Box.h</code>, <code>Ellipse.h</code>, <code>Circle.h</code>.
Each of these contains the
class declaration for a class of the same name. The shapes project uses
these 4 C++ classes.</p>
<p>- The header (<code>.h</code>) files are the
public face of classes. They contain the class declaration. A class
declaration states what data each object of that class contains, what
functions <em class="Lowlight">(called methods for
classes)</em> can be called for each object. It gives the
functions prototypes <span class="Lowlight"><em>(the
methods signatures)</em></span>. </p>
<p>- The <code>.cpp</code> files on the other hand <em>define
</em>the class methods. They store the code for the functions, at
least the most complex functions, as basic functions are allowed to be
defined <em>inline</em> in the class header.</p>
<hr />
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="caption">The Shapes project is composed of
4 classes:<br />
"Shape" is the <strong>base class</strong>. Every object
displayed on the program screen is a Shape. "Box" (a rectangle in
fact), "Ellipse", and "Circle" (a special kind of circle) are all <strong>derived
classes</strong>. They <strong>derive</strong> from
Shape. We also say that they <strong>inherit</strong> from
Shape.</p>
<p class="caption">We say that a <strong>derived

<p class="caption">The project uses derivation
(public inheritance in C++ terms) between these classes to make use of
the fact that boxes, ellipses and circles <strong>are</strong>
shapes. The diagram on the right uses a triangle to indicate the
inheritance relationship. (This conforms with the UML notation for
class relationships.)</p>
<p class="caption">As we can see, Box <strong>is

<h2>Building and running the "Artist" executable </h2>
<p>You can open any of the project files that are part of the
project by double-clicking on their name in the project window. </p>
<p>Before we do this however, let us compile and link "Artist",
and play a little with the program to get familiar with it:</p>
<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Select <span class="style47">Build</span>.</p>
<p>Code::Blocks compiles the 4 ".cpp" files with the
headers that they <code>#include</code>, then links them
together with the WinBGIm library to produce the executable "Artist.exe"<span class="abstract"></span>.
The commands it uses to compile and then link are displayed into a
"Build log" at the bottom of screen. </p>
<p><span class="abstract"><strong></strong></span><span class="abstract"><br />
</span></p>
</td>
<td><img style="width: 480px; height: 291px;" src="pic/build.gif" alt="build image" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You can now run the program by clicking on the executable
filename in a file manager, by calling the program at a console, or
within Code::Blocks by clicking on <em>Build-&gt;Run</em>.</p>
<p>The program gives some basic instructions on top of the screen:<br />
The user can select 3 kinds of shapes by pressing the associated
key,&nbsp;a <span class="string">B</span>ox <span class="caption">(a rectangle with vertical and horizontal
sides)</span>, an <span class="string">E</span>llipse,
or a <span class="string">C</span>ircle. The shape
dimensions and colors are determined by the random number generator.
The selected shape is shown on the screen. A "<em><strong>burst</strong></em>"
of shapes can be obtained by leaving the finger on the key for a short
time.</p>
<p>The selected shapes are added (as Shape pointers) to a vector
container. All the shapes in the collection can be shown at once by
pressing the | [<span class="string">D</span>]raw
Shapes | option key (<span class="string"><em>D</em></span>).<br />
___________</p>
<h2>How does it work? </h2>
<p>We will first examine the driver "<code>Artist.cpp</code>"
(the code that makes all the classes work together).</p>
<p>"Artist" uses the standard C random number generator function <code>rand()</code>
to obtain values for the geometric dimensions of each shape requested
by the user.</p>
<p>When <span class="string">B</span>, <span class="string">E</span>, or <span class="string">C</span>
are pressed:<br />
- An instance of the requested shape class (a <span class="string">box</span>,
or <span class="string">ellipse</span>, or <span class="string">circle</span> object) is created using <span class="keyword">new</span> and passing the geometric
data to the class constructor.<br />
- The sceen is then cleared and the new shape is drawn with<br />
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GrClearClipBox(BG_COLOR); <span class="comment">// Clears the screen, except the menu bar</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theShape-&gt;draw(); <span class="comment">// Show only the new shape<br />
</span></code>- A <em>pointer</em> to the
created object (<code>theShape</code>) is placed inside the
collection of shapes (a vector called <code>shapes</code>)
with<br />
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shapes.push_back(theShape);<br />
</code></p>
<p><code><span class="abstract">The beauty of
vectors is that they grow as needed. They can never fail when adding
data, unlike arrays that can crash your program if it tries to store
more into an array than the array can contain.<br />
In this project there is no way of knowing in advance how many shapes
the user will request, therefore a vector is all indicated. The vector
of shapes is created as a local variable in the main() function with:<br />
</span></code> <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vector&lt;Shape
*&gt; shapes; <span class="comment">// Collection of
stored shapes</span></code><span class="abstractCode"><span class="abstractComment"><br />
</span></span><span class="abstract">The
parameter between the angle brackets &lt; and &gt; is called a
"type parameter". It indicates what variable type (Shape pointers in
this case) the shapes vector will store.</span><br />
</p>
<p>When <span class="string">D</span> is
pressed:<br />
- The screen is cleared, then the shapes in the vector are drawn
sequentially, one by one on top of each other in a for loop:<br />
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">for</span>(<span class="keyword">int</span> i = 0; i &lt;
numShapes; i++)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shapes[i]-&gt;draw();</code></p>
<p>When <span class="string">W</span> is
pressed:<br />
- The screen is <span class="string">w</span>iped
clean, then the memory previously allocated to all the shapes in the
vector is released, each shape in its turn with:<br />
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">for</span>(<span class="keyword">int</span> i = 0; i &lt;
numShapes; i++)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">delete</span> shapes[i];</code><br />
<span class="keyword">delete</span> is passed the
Shape instance pointer previously created with <span class="keyword">new</span>.</p>
<p><span class="abstract"><span class="abstractCode"><strong>N</strong></span><strong>otice</strong>
that we obtain how many shapes have been stored in the vector <code>shapes</code>
with the statement:<br />
</span><span class="abstractCode">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><code>int
numShapes = shapes.size();</code> <span class="abstract"><br />
The vector at any time knows how many elements it contains... Easy<strong>!</strong></span><br />
___________</p>
<h2>Into the Guts of Classes</h2>
<p>The simplicity of this program is deceptive. It relies on the
expressive power of <em>inheritance</em> and <em>polymorphism</em>
available to C++ and to all object-oriented languages. Without
object-orientation this code would be much more messy. Let's examine
how <em>shapes</em> uses these features:</p>
<p><span class="title"><u>Inheritance</u><br />
</span>Boxes and ellipses <strong><em>are </em></strong>shapes.
The Box and Ellipse classes therefore inherit from the Shape class.
This is shown by the public inheritance in the class declarations:<br />
<span class="keyword"><code>class</code></span><code>
Ellipse: <span class="keyword">public</span> Shape<br />
{<br />
. . .<br />
<span class="keyword">class</span> Box : <span class="keyword">public</span> Shape<br />
{</code></p>
<p class="abstract"><u>Private</u> and <u>protected</u>
inheritance types also exist in C++. They are used extremely rarely and
do not represent the <strong>is_a</strong> relationship
between classes. We will ignore them in this document.</p>
<p>A circle <em><strong>is a </strong></em>kind
of ellipse <span class="Lowlight"><em>(where the
two axes are of equal dimensions)</em></span>. Therefore
the Circle class inherits from the Ellipse class with:<br />
<span class="keyword"><code>class</code></span><code>
Circle : <span class="keyword">public</span> Ellipse<br />
{</code></p>
<p>What inheritance means in practice is that all the code and
data that exist in the base class also exist in the derived class. It
has been "inherited" by the derived class.<br />
There is no need for example to repeat the Ellipse <code>draw()</code>
method within the Circle code as the ellipse function of the same name,
inherited by Circle will do the job just as well.</p>
<p>If a function of a base class needs to be replaced by another
with the same name and signature in the derived class, because the
behaviour of the inherited function does not fit the expected behaviour
of the derived class, this can be done simply by re-declaring the
function in the derived class header and writing the new function code
in the derived class <em>.cpp</em> file. We say in this
case that the derived class function <strong>overrides</strong>
the base class function.</p>
<p class="abstract">For this to work however we must
declare the method in the base class header to be <code class="keyword">virtual</code>. Briefly, this in an
instruction to the compiler to place the function address into a table
kept by the program called the "virtual table" or V-table. The virtual
table allows the program at runtime to find the proper function, even
though there may exist several functions with the same name and
signatures in the class hierarchy.</p>
<p><span class="abstract">Note that the default
destructor is a special class function that <u>must</u> be
declared virtual in the base class. This allows the proper destructor
to be called when a derived class object falls out of scope or is
deleted. This is done in Shape with:<br />
</span><span class="comment"><code>/**<br />
&nbsp;* Default destructor must be virtual to support inheritance<br />
&nbsp;*/</code></span><code><br />
<span class="keyword">virtual</span> ~Shape() {}</code></p>
<p>Shape is a special kind of class called an <strong>abstract
class</strong>. <br />
No object of the abstract class Shape can be created as such. Shape
instances can be created, but they will be created as Circle, Ellipse,
or Box instances. This is because Shape has one method, <span class="CaptionLarge">draw()</span>, that is declared
in the header, but never defined. <span class="CaptionLarge">draw()</span>
is itself called an <strong>abstract method</strong>:<br />
<span class="comment"><code>/**<br />
&nbsp;* Draw is abstract. It must be implemented by derived classes.<br />
&nbsp;*/<br />
</code></span><code><span class="keyword">virtual
void</span> draw() <span class="keyword">const</span>
= 0;</code></p>
<p>This is achieved by declaring draw() to be <code>virtual</code>
and <code>= 0</code>.</p>
<p><span class="title2">Why bother with inheritance?</span><br />
Inheritance saves coding. We can derive a new class from an existing
base class. By doing so we inherit all previously working code from the
base class. This saves work, is more efficient as the executable will
be smaller, and is safer since we re-use existing <span class="CaptionLarge">(and hopefully tested and solid)</span>
code. </p>
<p>For example we could add a <code>Square</code>
class and make it inherit from <code>Rectangle</code>...
no need to re-write <code>draw()</code> then, as the mehod
inherited from Rectangle will work just fine for Square:<br />
<span class="keyword"><code>class</code></span><code>
Square : <span class="keyword">public</span>
Rectangle<br />
{</code></p>
<p>But these advantages pale in comparison with the <span class="magicBright">magic of polymorphism</span> that
inheritance enables.</p>
<p class="title"><u>Polymorphism</u></p>

<p>The same function may have a variety of behaviours

<p class="comment"><br />
For the object-oriented programmer, polymorphism is just short of magic:</p>
<ul>
<li> Create a class hierarchy where all derived classes
override polymorphic methods <span class="CaptionLarge">(which
must be virtual in c++)</span> inherited from the base class, and
with the exact same signature <span class="CaptionLarge">(for
example draw() in "shapes")</span>.</li>
<li>Store object instances of the various derived classes as a
collection <span class="CaptionLarge">(array, or STL
container)</span> &nbsp;of base class pointers <span class="CaptionLarge">(a vector of Shape pointers in the
shapes project).<br />
</span></li>
<li>When the program calls the polymorphic method of objects in
the collection, the correct function will be selected and each object
will exhibit its proper behaviour <span class="CaptionLarge">(Circle
instances will draw as circles and Rectangle instances as rectangles)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In shapes, the polymorphic behaviour of each object stored in
the vector is invoked with the for loop:<br />
<code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="keyword">for</span>(<span class="keyword">int</span> i = 0; i &lt;
numShapes; i++)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shapes[i]-&gt;draw();</code></p>
<p>The <code>-&gt;</code> is required because
each element in the vector is a <u>pointer</u> to a shape
instance.</p>

is a 2D graphics drawing package for C or C++. Using WinBGIm does not
require event-driven programming; it is therefore very simple to use by
novice programmers. The library supports displaying shapes and images,
loading fonts and displaying text, catching mouse clicks and mouse
position and catching key-presses.<br />
