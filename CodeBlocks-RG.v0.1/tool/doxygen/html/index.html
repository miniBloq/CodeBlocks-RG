Version: 1.6.3
 </center><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C, Java, Objective-C, Python, IDL (Corba and Microsoft flavors), Fortran, VHDL, PHP, C#, and to some extent D.</p>
<p>It can help you in three ways: </p>
<ol>
<li>
It can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference manual (in <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mbox{\LaTeX}$" src="form_0.png"/>) from a set of documented source files. There is also support for generating output in RTF (MS-Word), PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man pages. The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code. </li>
<li>
You can <a class="el" href="starting.html#extract_all">configure</a> doxygen to extract the code structure from undocumented source files. This is very useful to quickly find your way in large source distributions. You can also visualize the relations between the various elements by means of include dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams, and collaboration diagrams, which are all generated automatically. </li>
<li>
You can even `abuse' doxygen for creating normal documentation (as I did for this manual). </li>
</ol>
<p>Doxygen is developed under <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a> and Mac OS X, but is set-up to be highly portable. As a result, it runs on most other Unix flavors as well. Furthermore, executables for Windows are available.</p>
<p><br/>
 This manual is divided into three parts, each of which is divided into several sections.</p>
<p>The first part forms a user manual: </p>

<h2>User examples</h2>
<p>Doxygen supports a number of <a class="el" href="output.html">output formats</a> where HTML is the most popular one. I've gathered  
<a href="http://www.doxygen.org/results.html">some nice examples</a> 
  of real-life projects using doxygen.</p>
<p>These are part of a larger  
<a href="http://www.doxygen.org/projects.html">list of projects</a> 
that use doxygen.
  If you know other projects, let <a href="mailto:dimitri@stack.nl?subject=New%20project%20using%20Doxygen">me</a> know and I'll add them.</p>
<h2>Commercial Support</h2>
<p>I'm currently investigating the possibilities of providing commercial support for doxygen. The forms of support I'm thinking of are: </p>
<ul>
<li>
implementing features, </li>
<li>
fixing bugs, </li>
<li>
providing priority help in answering questions. </li>
</ul>
<p>To get a better understanding of the feasibility, please let <a href="mailto:dimitri@stack.nl?subject=Doxygen%20Commercial%20Support">me</a> know if you have a need for this type (or another type) of doxygen related commercial support.</p>
<h2>Future work</h2>
<p>Although doxygen is successfully used by large number of companies and open source projects already, there is always room for improvement. </p>
<p>You can submit enhancement requests in <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?product=doxygen&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;bug_severity=enhancement">the bug tracker</a>. Make sure the severity of the bug report is set to "enhancement".</p>
