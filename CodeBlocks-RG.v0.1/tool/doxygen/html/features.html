<ul>
<li>
Requires very little overhead from the writer of the documentation. Plain text will do, but for more fancy or structured output HTML tags and/or some of doxygen's special commands can be used. </li>
<li>
Supports C/C++, Java, (Corba and Microsoft) Java, Python, IDL, C#, Objective-C and to some extent D and PHP sources. </li>
<li>
Supports documentation of files, namespaces, packages, classes, structs, unions, templates, variables, functions, typedefs, enums and defines. </li>
<li>
JavaDoc (1.1), Qt-Doc, and ECMA-334 (C# spec.) compatible. </li>
<li>
Automatically generates class and collaboration diagrams in HTML (as clickable image maps) and <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mbox{\LaTeX}$" src="form_0.png"/> (as Encapsulated PostScript images). </li>
<li>
Uses the dot tool of the Graphviz tool kit to generate include dependency graphs, collaboration diagrams, call graphs, directory structure graphs, and graphical class hierarchy graphs. </li>
<li>
Flexible comment placement: Allows you to put documentation in the header file (before the declaration of an entity), source file (before the definition of an entity) or in a separate file. </li>
<li>
Generates a list of all members of a class (including any inherited members) along with their protection level. </li>
<li>
Outputs documentation in on-line format (HTML and UNIX man page) and off-line format (<img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mbox{\LaTeX}$" src="form_0.png"/> and RTF) simultaneously (any of these can be disabled if desired). All formats are optimized for ease of reading. <br/>
 Furthermore, compressed HTML can be generated from HTML output using Microsoft's HTML Help Workshop (Windows only) and PDF can be generated from the <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mbox{\LaTeX}$" src="form_0.png"/> output. </li>
<li>
Includes a full C preprocessor to allow proper parsing of conditional code fragments and to allow expansion of all or part of macros definitions. </li>
<li>
Automatically detects public, protected and private sections, as well as the Qt specific signal and slots sections. Extraction of private class members is optional. </li>
<li>
Automatically generates references to documented classes, files, namespaces and members. Documentation of global functions, globals variables, typedefs, defines and enumerations is also supported. </li>
<li>
References to base/super classes and inherited/overridden members are generated automatically. </li>
<li>
Includes a fast, rank based search engine to search for strings or words in the class and member documentation. </li>
<li>
You can type normal HTML tags in your documentation. Doxygen will convert them to their equivalent <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\mbox{\LaTeX}$" src="form_0.png"/>, RTF, and man-page counterparts automatically. </li>
<li>
Allows references to documentation generated for other projects (or another part of the same project) in a location independent way. </li>
<li>
Allows inclusion of source code examples that are automatically cross-referenced with the documentation. </li>
<li>
Inclusion of undocumented classes is also supported, allowing to quickly learn the structure and interfaces of a (large) piece of code without looking into the implementation details. </li>
<li>
Allows automatic cross-referencing of (documented) entities with their definition in the source code. </li>
<li>
All source code fragments are syntax highlighted for ease of reading. </li>
<li>
Allows inclusion of function/member/class definitions in the documentation. </li>
<li>
All options are read from an easy to edit and (optionally) annotated configuration file. </li>
<li>
Documentation and search engine can be transferred to another location or machine without regenerating the documentation. </li>
<li>
Can cope with large projects easily. </li>
</ul>
<p>Although doxygen can now be used in any project written in a language that is supported by doxygen, initially it was specifically designed to be used for projects that make use of Qt Software's <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt.html">Qt toolkit</a>. I have tried to make doxygen `Qt-compatible'. That is: Doxygen can read the documentation contained in the Qt source code and create a class browser that looks quite similar to the one that is generated by Qt Software. Doxygen understands the C++ extensions used by Qt such as signals and slots and many of the markup commands used in the Qt sources.</p>
<p>Doxygen can also automatically generate links to existing documentation that was generated with Doxygen or with Qt's non-public class browser generator. For a Qt based project this means that whenever you refer to members or classes belonging to the Qt toolkit, a link will be generated to the Qt documentation. This is done independent of where this documentation is located! </p>
